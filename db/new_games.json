The player is required to push B\/Triangle while standing still to shoot the grappling hook diagonally, while running forward causes you to shoot forward, and firing up while looking up shoots it up. \u00a0The hook is used to reach different platforms in the game (replacing the above mentioned jump button). <br\/><br\/>  Also, you have the power to crouch and fire off your grappling hook at concrete barriers on the ground to slide across the floor, and grabbing a barrel lets you bring it towards yourself and use it as a weapon and shield. Certain stone walls can be pulled away by using the bionic arm, and enemies can be grabbed and thrown\/used as human shields when an upgrade is applied later in the game.<br\/><br\/>  A new\u00a0mechanic\u00a0was introduced in Rearmed which was absent from the NES version of the game. In order to hack into enemy computers, you must shoot a ball in different directions hitting blocks, trying to get to the green block. These puzzles get more and more challenging as the game progresses, and start to incorporate such things as teleports.\u00a0The A button is the shoot button and requires multiple button presses to get multiple shots off. <br\/><br\/>Another new addition is the ability to gain momentum while suspended. While players got stuck and were forced to drop down in order to shoot their arm to move again in the original title, Rearmed allows the shotgun to propel Spencer backwards to start swinging again.<br\/><br\/> <h2>Weapons <\/h2>Nathan \"Rad\" Spencer has a wide variety of weapons in his arsenal, many of which unlock via progressing through the game's many levels. Weapons upgrade when the particular item is found in secret areas or allied bases.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Revolver <br\/><\/h3>The Revolver is a Standard Issue .45 with a nickname of \"Daisy.\" The single-fire pistol is able to shoot three bullets\u00a0 at a time when upgraded and deals minimal but effective damage.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Grenades<\/h3>Grenades are thrown, usually over barriers to reach crouched and hiding enemies. Holding down while throwing it drops the grenade to the platform directly beneath Spencer. They are useful for dealing with groups, machines, and unreachable foes.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Plasma Rifle<\/h3>The Plasma Rifle is a laser weapon that deals very little damage to human enemies, but dishes out lethal force to mechanical beings. It is most effective against patrolling robots and bosses.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Bazooka<\/h3>A traditional rocket launcher with varying accuracy and enormous power. A single-fire weapon, it kills most standard enemies instantly, and is lethal to the player should they be standing too close to the resulting explosion. The bazooka is upgraded in the final level of the game and allows remote control via the right analog stick (consoles) to maneuver the wayward rocket. Since it deals incredible damage, firing rockets at bosses and groups is very effective.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Shotgun<\/h3>The 13 gauge \"Hagle Breaker\" is essential for close combat. While useless at long range, the forceful impact of the spread will kill standard soldiers in a single shot. Shooting the shotgun while suspended from your bionic arm results in momentous propulsion, giving the player a chance to swing again wheras they'd normally have to drop to whatever doom awaited below.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Vector Cannon<\/h3>This rebounding laser is effective against machines and humans, and is essential for reaching meticulously placed turrets or gunmen. The rebounding shot arcs at a 45 degree angle and shoots up or down depending on the player's standing\/crouching stance.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Joe's Machine Gun<\/h3>This rapid-fire machine gun deals phenomenal damage at a high rate. Essential for quick clean ups and taking down groups, the weapon will push players backwards, if they aren't running while shooting. The weapon initially belonged to Super Joe, and is available upon his rescue.<br\/><br\/> <h2>Body Upgrades<\/h2> <h3>The Helmet, Shin Guards and Bullet Proof Vest <\/h3>The Helmet, Shin Guards and Bullet Proof Vest all allow players to take an extra hit of damage without it affecting their Hit Points. Once hit with a bullet, the respective piece of armor will degrade and fall off, as indicated by its gold logo flinging off of the character. When one is equipped, one shot is deflected; when two\u00a0 are equipped, two shots are equipped; when three are equipped, three shots are stopped.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Iron Boots<\/h3>Unlocking and equipping the Iron Boots means players that swing in to most enemies will plant their metal foot in to their face and likely kill them instantly. Some enemies are not affected by the attack, such as the bulky blue Bomb Expert, Shielded Soldiers and most bosses.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Health Recovery Pills<\/h3>The pills are actually a liquid that increase your total health. The fact that the \"pills\" are a liquid is joked about in a dialogue between Spencer and Hayley. This is a reference to the NES version of Bionic Commando where the icon for Health Recovery Pills was also a liquid.<br\/><br\/> <h3>Power Claw<\/h3>The Power Claw allows Spencer to grab enemies and throw them, which immediately kills them, or use them as human shields to absorb incoming bullets. Grabbing and throwing an enemy negates any item drops such as health or bonus points.<br\/><br\/> Stand still and press B to fire your grappling hook diagonally.The main gameplay elements introduced in the Nintendo\u00a0Entertainment\u00a0System (NES) version of the game have been kept almost intact in this version of Bionic\u00a0Commando. <br\/><br\/> <h2>Pricing and Availability <\/h2>Bionic Commando Rearmed retails for 800 Microsoft Points on Xbox Live Arcade, $9.99 on PlayStation Network, and $14.99 for the PC via digital distribution. The PSN version will be Remote Play compatible. The game is scheduled to release on August 13, 2008 (XBLA) with the PSN and PC versions following on the 14th. The list for digital distributors on the PC is yet to be confirmed.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>Producer Ben Judd announced on August 13, 2008 that the PC version of Bionic Commando:\u00a0 Rearmed will feature additional challenge rooms included in a free patch to be released sometime after the game's release.\u00a0 Judd did not announce when this additional content would be released for the PC, or whether console players would have a chance to purchase this additional content. Though becoming fairly standard with digitally distributed PC titles, Bionic Commando was not released via Valve's service, Steam upon release. Capcom claimed that they could not reach agreeable terms with Valve, leaving the game to be distributed solely through Capcom's online store. \u00a0However, the game has since been released on steam for $9\/9\u20ac<br\/><br\/><h2>Characters<\/h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Rad Spencer<\/b>: Rad Spencer is the protagonist that the p-layer assumes control of in Rearmed.

The game features an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-207\" href=\"\/open-world\/3015-207\/\">open world<\/a> for the player to explore where they pick up <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1422\" href=\"\/questing\/3015-1422\/\">quests<\/a> from other survivors on the island, and has an emphasis on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-444\" href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\">melee combat<\/a>. It supports up to four players with drop-in drop-out cooperative multiplayer. It was originally planned for a 2008 release, but subsequently entered <a href=\"..\/..\/development-hell\/92-1339\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">development hell<\/a>. After various delays, it was released on the <a href=\"..\/..\/xbox-360\/60-20\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox 360<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/playstation-3\/60-35\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation 3<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/pc\/60-94\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PC<\/a> on September 6th 2011 to a cool reception.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">Although the player chooses one of four playable characters to start the game, the game will unfold exactly the same with each character, in both single player and in co-op.<\/p><h3>Act I<\/h3><p style=\"\">The story starts off with the player waking up alone in a hotel room, unaware that overnight the island has become overrun with zombies. As the player makes his way out of the hotel, a voice comes on over the loudspeakers, directing him to safety and away from pursuing zombies. The player then reawakens in a beach hut with survivors. After helping them fend off a zombie attack, <a href=\"..\/..\/john-sinamoi\/94-20450\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Sinamoi<\/a> informs the player that he has been in contact with someone else on a radio who promises he can help, but the signal is too weak. They need to get everyone to the main lifeguard tower where there are medical supplies and a stronger radio. After the player clears that area of zombies, the survivors relocate there, only to discover the antenna for the radio is broken.<\/p><p style=\"\">To repair the antenna, the player must travel to the lighthouse, where other survivors are also congregating. In order to get the antenna repaired, the player must first help the lighthouse survivors get the power turned back on. After fixing the power, fixing the antenna, and collecting food and water for the survivors, Sinamoi asks the player to retrieve a heavy truck from the hotel. After fighting through zombies at the hotel and getting the armored truck, the player takes it to <a href=\"..\/..\/earl\/94-21084\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earl<\/a>, a mechanic who can reinforce the truck turning it into a rolling fortress. Earl\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"..\/..\/jin\/94-20929\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jin<\/a>, convinces the player to use the truck to deliver food and medicine to other survivors at Saint Christopher\u2019s Church.<\/p><h3>Act II<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once arriving at the church, the player meets Mother Helen and another band of survivors, and she informs the player that the water supply to the church is not working, and needs help turning it back on. The pump station is across town, and once the player gets there, they find it is also occupied by survivors, but this time they are hostile gang members that immediately begin firing guns at the player. After defeating these enemies, the player must turn off a series of hydrants and then battle his way through the underground sewers to cut the water flow to the canals, and open the floodgates.<\/p><p style=\"\">Coming out the other side of the sewers leads the player to the Town Hall, where yet another band of survivors is holed up. They are low on supplies and are unwilling to help the player, so the heroes argue about the situation and believe that the mysterious voice on the radio is their only way off the island. Logan calls Jin on the walkie-talkie to come pick them up but she objects, saying that they're meant to help everyone survive, and threatens to take the armored car &amp; leave them. They reluctantly agree to help.<\/p><p style=\"\">The player then goes to gather supplies at a nearby supermarket that has been overrun by gang members. After battling through the store, they find a large cache of food, but when the player returns to the Town Hall they find everyone dead from zombies. The heroes decide to go back to the church.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once back at the church, Mother Helen informs them that Jin left to go help the thugs at the Police Station and asks that you go look for her and retrieve the armored car. Turns out they kidnapped her and she needs rescuing. The player fights his way back through the sewers and the police station to get Jin, and then returns to give supplies to the church survivors. The player then take the supplies and the armored truck back to Sinamoi, who tells them the antenna is still too weak to reach the voice on the radio. So the plan is to use an antenna that is on top of the hotel, in hopes that one is strong enough. Once the player reaches the hotel roof, they finally get a hold of the voice on the radio who identifies himself as <a href=\"..\/..\/ryder-white\/94-20930\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ryder White<\/a>, a colonel with the Banoi Island Defense Force. He promises they will be picked up by helicopter if they can reach him on a separate nearby island which houses a prison. But the prison is surrounded by mines, so White tells them they will need to find a smuggler named <a href=\"..\/..\/mowen\/94-20931\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mowen<\/a>, who knows the way through the mines. Using old Japanese WWII bunkers &amp; tunnels, the player travels with Jin inland into the jungle to find Mowen.<\/p><h3>Act III<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once the player enters the jungle, they meet Matutero, a local who agrees to help them get to Mowen if they find and kill Afran, a gang leader who stole his boat. Once the boat is acquired, they are able to navigate the swamps and meet up with Mowen, but he claims he doesn\u2019t know how to get to the prison. Instead he informs the player that he knows of a secret laboratory in the jungle where the zombie virus originated from, and takes them there.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once at the laboratory, the player meets <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-robert-west\/94-20934\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Robert West<\/a> who is in charge of the lab. He claims the lab is just a cosmetic testing lab that is only in the jungle to escape animal rights activists, but other clues around the lab suggest otherwise. After helping out a few scientists in the lab, Dr. West informs the player that there are some local natives that are immune to the virus, and he needs blood samples from them to attempt a cure. Ryder White is very interested in a vaccine as well, for his wife has been bitten and he wants to save her, and he urges the player to bring some to him.<\/p><p style=\"\">After analyzing some blood from the natives, Dr. West believes he can create a vaccine if he has a more stable version of the virus. This requires the player to find a native who hasn\u2019t had any contact with the virus at all, even if it is dead tissue. A tribal leader agrees to show the player to their catacombs, where they find <a href=\"..\/..\/yerema\/94-20936\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yerema<\/a>, an abused young woman. The player saves her and leads her back to the boat, where Mowen is being attacked by zombies. The player saves him too, then drops off Yerema and a sample from the catacombs at Dr. West\u2019s lab.<\/p><p style=\"\">Back at the boat, Mowen tells the player that he really does know the way to the prison, and will show him in appreciation for saving his life. Going back to the lab one more time, the player finds it overrun with zombies, and Yerema alive but locked in a cage. The player frees her and grabs the antidote that Dr. West made and heads back to the boat, where they depart for the prison to meet up with Ryder White in cell block C.<\/p><h3>Act IV<\/h3><p style=\"\">The player successfully navigates the mine field and arrives at the prison with Yerema, Jin, and Mowen. Mowen knows some of the prisoners, and they meet up with <a href=\"..\/..\/titus-kabui\/94-20932\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Titus<\/a>. Titus will show them to cell block C if the player helps him get some food and weapons, and free an inmate who is locked in solitary. Ryder contacts the player of the radio, urging him to forget about helping the prisoners and get to him as soon as possible, using the sewers. Once through the sewers, the player runs into Yerema and Jin, who inform the player that Titus and the others were overrun by zombies, and Mowen traded his boat to them so they would tell him how to find the player. But Mowen was then killed by the undead along the way.<\/p><p style=\"\">The player enters an elevator, which is flooded with knockout gas as soon as the door closes. The characters awake later, and meet <a href=\"..\/..\/kevin\/94-20933\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kevin<\/a>, a tech-savvy prisoner who had helped them previously. Kevin reveals that Ryder White has stolen their vaccine while they were knocked out and is attempting to flee. He also says that White is going to bomb the islands once he has escaped, so they must get to White\u2019s chopper on the roof and stop him.<\/p><p style=\"\">The player battles his way to the roof and find White with his wife strapped to a gurney. White refuses to hand over the vaccine, so Jin releases the wife from her restraints, and she bites White. White shoots his wife &amp; Jin, and then quickly injects the vaccine. But the vaccine's formula is flawed, and White transforms into a large hulking zombie, and the player must kill him. The player escapes Banoi in White\u2019s helicopter with Kevin and Yerema, and the game ends with Kevin giving a knowing grin suggesting he has a more sinister agenda.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Players will progress through the game by completing quests that are given by NPCs. Other than the main quest line, there are numerous <a href=\"..\/..\/side-quests\/92-338\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">side quests<\/a> that, while optional, will provide the player with rewards like better weapons, new weapon mods, or sometimes just good ol' cash.<\/p><h3>Attacking<\/h3><p style=\"\">Since the setting of the game is a civilian island, firearms &amp; ammo are scarce, so the focus is more on <a href=\"..\/..\/improvised-weapon\/92-3091\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">improvised melee weapons<\/a>. Players will have to do most of their zombie killing up close and personal with items they find in the environment, which ranges from pipes &amp; shovels, to machetes &amp; sledgehammers, and much more. On top of being able to slash and swing melee weapons, players can also throw any weapon for distance attacks. There is also a front kick option, which can damage and knock down enemies. Players can enter <a href=\"..\/..\/fury\/92-4069\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fury Mode<\/a>, which is a special superhuman alt-mode that goes completely unexplained and grants different bonuses and special attacks depending on which character the player is controlling.<\/p><h3>Stamina<\/h3><p style=\"\">There is a <a href=\"..\/..\/stamina-bar\/92-3569\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">stamina bar<\/a> that governs the actions of the player. The bar will deplete when attacking, sprinting, &amp; jumping, so players must choose their attacks carefully. If the stamina bar empties, the player cannot perform these actions until more stamina regenerates, which happens automatically when walking or standing still.<\/p><h3>Loot<\/h3><p style=\"\">As players go through the game, there is ample opportunity to collect <a href=\"..\/..\/loot-gathering\/92-161\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">loot<\/a> from the environment. Loot comes in many forms. Players will be able to find new weapons &amp; blueprints, health, cash, as well as miscellaneous items like wire, bleach, batteries, etc. These items can be used at benches to modify weapons for additional damage. Materials and weapons can also be purchased from <a href=\"..\/..\/merchants\/92-806\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">traders<\/a> that are found throughout the game.<\/p><h3>Benches<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63119\/2005200-deadislandbench.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005200\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63119\/2005200-deadislandbench.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005200\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/6\/63119\/2005200-deadislandbench.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Benches can repair and modify weapons<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"..\/..\/workbench\/93-4482\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benches<\/a> allow the player to do three different things to their weapons, all of which requires various amounts of cash:<\/p><ul><li><b>Repairing:<\/b> All weapons in the game wear down as they are used, and require constant repairing so they don't break.

This XP goes towards leveling up, and each time a character levels up they gain 1 point to put towards skills in their <a href=\"..\/..\/skill-tree\/92-382\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">skill tree<\/a>. Although each character's skill tree has the same three general branches, the specific skills within each one are mostly unique to that character:<\/p><ul><li><b>Fury<\/b> - This branch levels up Fury mode, the high damage mode the character can enter for a limited time.<\/li><li><b>Combat<\/b> - This branch levels up the offensive side of things, like increased damage, better critical chance, quicker reloads, etc.<\/li><li><b>Survival<\/b> - This branch levels up things like lockpicking, increased loot, decreasing melee damage received, increased weapon durability, etc.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Zombies<\/h2><p style=\"\">Dead Island features a detailed damage system for the zombies. Each enemy has multiple layers to them, and will show damage depending on where you hit them and what you hit them with. Skin can be torn, limbs will come off, and bones can be broken. For example, a baseball bat can break a zombie's arm, rendering it useless, while a machete can just cut the whole arm off. Each zombie has its own health bar, stamina bar, and level, which will scale along with the player as they level up.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are seven different types of zombies in the game, and each was designed with two concepts in mind: making a challenging but still fun to combat threat for the player to deal with.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td>Walker - These are the most common enemy in the game.

The player controls DeathSpank on his quest for The Artifact, in a <a href=\"\/satire\/3015-1076\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1076\">satirical<\/a> single-player campaign that pokes fun at fantasy and role-playing cliches.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">As one may be able to guess about DeathSpank, the story is only barely-sensical. The game opens up with the coveted Artifact just barely out of DeathSpank's reach. After an appropriately lengthy prologue, DeathSpank finally obtains The Artifact only to lose it to a group of the evil <a href=\"\/lord-von-prong\/3005-15956\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15956\">Lord Von Prong's Orque<\/a> <a href=\"\/henchmen\/3015-594\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-594\">henchmen<\/a>. The henchmen leave DeathSpank with no <a href=\"\/inventory\/3015-513\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-513\">equipment<\/a> (though the game feels no need to go for the <a href=\"\/left-4-dead\/3030-20690\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20690\">\"Left For Dead\"<\/a> scenario). DeathSpank reaches a nearby town, and after regaining a weapon and helping some of the <a href=\"\/pedestrians\/3015-5560\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5560\">townsfolk<\/a>, the <a href=\"\/mayor\/3015-5846\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5846\">Mayor<\/a> contracts our hero to recover a group of <a href=\"\/orphan\/3015-2205\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2205\">orphans<\/a> that have gone missing. With his new, trusty Orphan Sack (that is, a <a href=\"\/bag\/3055-3782\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3782\">sack<\/a> which one stuffs orphans into for safe-keeping), DeathSpank sets out on the land (which include areas such as The Haunted <a href=\"\/forest\/3035-1889\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1889\">Forest<\/a>, The Enchanted Forest, The Turtle <a href=\"\/lake\/3035-2096\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2096\">Lake<\/a>, The Enchanted Forest Logging Camp, and many more) to help the downtrodden, rescue the orphans of the land, help the Mayor with his recycling campaign, vanquish Lord Von Prong, and, most importantly, get some <a href=\"\/loot-gathering\/3015-161\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-161\">loot<\/a>!<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">DeathSpank is a <a href=\"\/loot-gathering\/3015-161\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-161\">loot<\/a>-driven action-RPG surrounded by dialog and <a href=\"\/puzzles\/3015-932\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzles<\/a> reminiscent of point-and-click adventure games.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Justice Meter is charged as DeathSpank slaughters more and more of his enemies. This will allow him to perform <a href=\"\/special-attacks\/3015-327\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-327\">special attacks<\/a> with certain weapons. These weapons are identified by a purple circle behind the illustration in the equipment screen. When selected, a description of their special effect is supplied. By finding <a href=\"\/runes\/3055-1061\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1061\">Runes<\/a>, you can combine the special abilities of two weapons simultaneously to combine effects.<\/p><p style=\"\">As DeathSpank searches for The Artifact, he will encounter many <a href=\"\/non-player-character\/3015-967\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs<\/a> in need of assistance and marked by an <a href=\"\/exclamation-mark\/3015-818\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-818\">exclamation point<\/a> over their heads. By talking to these characters, the player will obtain a <a href=\"\/questing\/3015-1422\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1422\">quest<\/a> which will then be added to the quest log. The player may be asked to complete a simple task or solve a more intricate puzzle. Puzzles are often solved by finding and <a href=\"\/item-combination\/3015-2396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2396\">combining different items<\/a> to create the desired results. Once the task requested by the quest-giver has been completed, DeathSpank will need to return to an NPC to claim a reward. In some cases, the NPC may have a new quest available once one has been completed.<\/p><p style=\"\">The dialog when talking to NPCs closely resembles that of traditional point-and-click adventure games. You will see a portrait of the character on the screen along with text as they speak. At key points in the conversation, the player will have an opportunity to respond. A box will appear at the bottom of the screen with a number of possible responses from which the player may select.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6820\/1414964-e3_screenshot071.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1414964\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6820\/1414964-e3_screenshot071.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1414964\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/6820\/1414964-e3_screenshot071.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>DeathSpank battles Sergeant Orque<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">True to the conventions of the genre, the game distributes new gear for DeathSpank in the form of <a href=\"\/random-loot\/3015-365\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-365\">random loot<\/a> drops. As the player kills enemies, they will drop items on the ground which you may pick up. The player will often find new weapons, armor, and collectibles which may be equipped to improve DeathSpank's abilities. Support items such as <a href=\"\/potion\/3055-79\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-79\">potions<\/a> and <a href=\"\/healing-food\/3015-462\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-462\">food<\/a> can also be found, which are used for recovering <a href=\"\/health\/3015-130\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health<\/a>.\\<\/p><p style=\"\">One unusual feature included is a Lost and Found system. Lost and Found bins are placed throughout the world where DeathSpank may retrieve items which were dropped previously but never picked up.<\/p><h3>Loot\/Equipment<\/h3><p style=\"\">As promised by the developers, DeathSpank features loot! And lots of it. However, the equipment found in the game lacks the depth of <a href=\"\/perks\/3015-366\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-366\">\"perks\"<\/a> that rival games have. In other games, such as Diablo or <a href=\"\/torchlight\/3030-25983\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25983\">Torchlight<\/a>, it's common for equipment or weapons to have health\/ <a href=\"\/mana\/3015-257\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-257\">mana<\/a> regeneration <a href=\"\/attributes\/3015-1681\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\">stats<\/a> or leech health stats or reflect damage stats. None of those things exist in the universe of DeathSpank. Armor in the game strictly increases the number of <a href=\"\/hit-points\/3015-400\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">hit points<\/a> of the titular character, while maybe granting some elemental ( <a href=\"\/fire\/3015-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1443\">Fire<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ice\/3015-4238\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4238\">Ice<\/a>, <a href=\"\/undead\/3015-1155\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1155\">Undead<\/a>, Nature) resistance. With weapons, it's strictly about the physical (or base) damage plus whatever elemental bonus damage the weapon may have. This often makes the best choice for weapons and armor obvious throughout the game (there is even a button to automatically equip the best armor as it becomes available). All of the weapons and armor in the game can be seen on the character model.<\/p><h3>Multiplayer<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6820\/1414960-e3_screenshot041.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1414960\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6820\/1414960-e3_screenshot041.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1414960\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/6820\/1414960-e3_screenshot041.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Sparkles provides some much-needed assistance of the magical variety.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">If another controller is connected, the game will prompt the player to <a href=\"\/must-press-start-to-play\/3015-4785\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4785\">press start to join<\/a> at which point they will manifest in the game as <a href=\"\/sparkles-the-wizard\/3005-15934\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15934\">Sparkles the Wizard<\/a>.

One of the game's innovative mechanics is how Titus's health is managed. He has a shield that regenerates but a health bar that doesn't. Furthermore the only way for him to regain health is by curb stomping enemies. Since many of these baddies travel in packs, players have to weigh the risk of being attacked with the reward of regaining health.The class-based multiplayer contains customizable Space Marines of the Imperium and the Chaos Space Marines. The two multiplayer modes available at launch were Annihilation (standard <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"\/team-deathmatch\/3015-2463\/\">team deathmatch<\/a>) and Seize Ground (similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1292\" href=\"\/king-of-the-hill\/3015-1292\/\">King of the Hill<\/a>).

A 150 year old veteran and still considered relatively young, he is a decorated veteran of major campaigns waged across the galaxy \u2013 his exploits have earned him a reputation as one of the mightiest Ultramarines.<\/p><p style=\"\">Over his long service, Titus has overcome countless opponents and suffered many wounds, both physical and psychological. In his earliest days, he struggled to overcome his own temper. Later, he survived the death of his entire squad at the hands of a Chaos Sorcerer; Titus killed the fiend, but suffered terrible wounds -- and some questioned how he survived.<\/p><p style=\"\">Titus became company commander when his predecessor died in battle. He was by his mentor's side when he fell, and still feels the weight of taking over his mantle.<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Sergeant Sidonus<\/b><\/u> (voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-35253\" href=\"\/richard-hawley\/3040-35253\/\">Richard Hawley<\/a>)<\/p><p style=\"\">A veteran warrior with 225 years of experience defending the Imperium from the menaces of space. He lost his arm in a battle with the Tyranids and uses a bionic replacement. Also much of his face is scarred from the blast of an Eldar weapon that also took one of his eyes. So many years of fighting have left him with an attitude of 'been there, done that, no problem' and a dry sense of humor that reveals itself during moments of tense stress. Along with his experience comes a warrior of great efficiency that will not stop until every last enemy is dead.<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Leondros<\/b><\/u> (voiced by Noah Huntley)<\/p><p style=\"\">The most recent member of Captain Titus command squad. He could be considered a typical Ultramarine with his formal speech and devotion to do things just right.

He patronizes the surviving <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1312\" href=\"\/imperial-guard\/3015-1312\/\">Imperial Guard<\/a> for their short comings. As a younger recruit, he looks up the older veterans, especially Titus. He aspires to be like them and, at times, will go overboard with attempting to prove himself.<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Second Lieutenant Mira<\/b><\/u> (voiced by Christine Roberts)<\/p><p style=\"\">Mira is the leader of the surviving Imperial Guard Forces on the Forge World, remnants of a much larger detachment that was decimated when the Orks invaded the planet. She was part of the 203rd Cadian Regiment that was en route to another warzone, but was diverted to the Forge World as the only Imperial Guard force nearby. Mira's men are firecely loyal to her, a loyalty that is inspired by her skill as a tactician and her deep humanity. Her primary goal is to ensure the survival of the men she leads.<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Inquisitor Drogan<\/b><\/u> (voiced by Danny Webb)<\/p><p style=\"\">Drogan is a member of The Inquisition - a shadowy organization charged with eliminating the foes of humanity. He was once fell captured by alien foes, which led to years of torture. This has resulted in him having a deep hatred for aliens, and because of this he has spent his life creating new and more effective ways to eliminate them. This obsession has led him to seek technologies thought lost or impossible to the Imperium, and has resulted in the development of a power source that is capable of producing tremendous amounts of mysterious energy.<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Chaos Lord Nemeroth<\/b><\/u><\/p><p style=\"\">Nemeroth once exemplified what a Space Marine should be. Over the centuries, however, he grew disillusioned with the traditions and rules Space Marines are required to live by. The Chaos Gods took this chance to seduce Nemeroth with promises of great power, both physical and psychic. Having tasted this power, he craves it even more. He has completely abandoned his humanity, and his ultimate goal is to transcend it completely.<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Warboss Grimskull<\/b><\/u><\/p><p style=\"\">Orks are brutal by nature, and this brutality leads to them fighting each other more than their other enemies much of the time. It is only when a Warboss crushes his rivals and unites several tribes that a WAAAAGH! begins, which is a combination of migration and holy war. Warboss Grimskull is as mighty as any Warboss and more cunning than most. His strategy is simple but effective: identify the enemies weak spots and crush them.

However, when they engage in combat they do so <i>en masse<\/i> serving as a good distraction for the larger Orks.<\/li><li>Bomb Squig: The simplest form of Orkoid life, Squigs are little more than fanged mouths on legs. To make these creatures even more lethal, however, Orks often strap crude explosive devices to their backs and send them on suicide charges into the enemy lines.<\/li><li>Shoota Boyz: A medium sized Ork, Shoota Boyz love guns and the fire power they produce. This fact, as well their great numbers, allows them to form the backbone of the Greenskin ranged forces.<\/li><li>Shoota Boy Pro: More elite and experienced than the normal shoota boyz, these are boyz are equipped with Rokkit Launchas.<\/li><li>Slugga Boyz: About the same size as Shoota boys but prefer close quarter combat. The most common type of Ork and the backbone of any proper WAAAGH. They form mobs and mostly blind rush their opposition. Though there are a few clever ones who wear protective gear even if a lot of the time it is ineffective against a Space Marine's bolter.<\/li><li>Slugga Boyz Pro: A more skilled version of the standard Slugga Boy, this Ork has cobbled himself some rudimentary armour and has thrown away his crude choppa for a more advanced chain weapon.<\/li><li>'Ard Boyz: 'Ard Boyz are more heavily armored than their Shoota or Slugga counterparts, and also have a natural resilience that makes them able to soak up fire that would destroy other members of their species. While the armor worn by the 'Ard Boyz is crude and usually made of salvaged metal, they also wield a heavy riot shield and choppa for up close encounters.<\/li><li>Slugga Nob: The Nobz are the ruling class of the Orks. These are Orks that have undergone so much combat that they have grown to superhuman sizes and strong enough to crush lesser Orks who would challenge them. They become impervious to attacks that would destroy lesser Orks and they use their size and strength to wield giant 2-handed choppas.<\/li><li>Slugga Nob Pro: Even stronger than his already enormous brethren, this Nob is capable of taking on even the most elite troops.<\/li><li>Shoota Nob: Similar to the Slugga Nob, the Shoota Nob is part of the ruling class of Orks. Unlike the Slugga Nobs, they favor big, loud guns over the close combat weapons used by their counterparts. The wealth of a Shoota Nob, accumulated from his years of combat, allows him to attain even bigger and louder weapons.<\/li><li>Shoota Nob Pro: An upgrade to the standard Shoota Nob, this Ork has upgraded his arsenal to include advanced weapons and armor.<\/li><li>Storm Boyz: These are Orks that favor close-combat like the Slugga Boyz, but also live for the thrill of speed. To attain this thrill they strap crude rocket jump packs onto their backs and gamble their lives in order to jump into the thick of combat at break-neck speeds.<\/li><li>Weirdboy: Weirdboyz are Ork psykers that harness the nearby WAAAAGH! energy of other Orks to unleash devastating psychic attacks. As well as offensive powers, more talented Weirdboyz posses the ability to teleport themselves and other Orks.<\/li><li>Warboss: All Orks are around the same size when they fully mature, however, it is only through fighting and survival that some grow to the truly enormous size of Nobz, the ruling caste.

These renegades are equipped with lasguns and grenades but don't pose a significant threat to a well trained Space Marine.<\/li><li>Chaos Space Marine: Chaos Space Marines are the darker versions of the heroes of the game. They were once Space Marines as well, before falling to the tempting powers of Chaos. These Chaos Space Marines are brutally efficient and revel in deadly precision.<\/li><li>Havoc: These are the heavy weapons specialists in the forces of Chaos. Armed with heavy equipment like Heavy Bolters and Missile Launchers, they can cut down even the most heavily armored Space Marine. They can also be equipped with lascannons, autocannons, and plasma cannons.<\/li><li>Raptor: The Raptors are fast assault troops. They swoop down on their foes with their back-mounted jump packs. They possess basic sidearms and chain swords, in order to make it easier to cut down their foes in close combat.<\/li><li>Tainted Psyker: Psykers are humans who have psychic powers that allow them to call on the powers of the warp. These powers, however, come with the risk of attracting the influence of the daemons that inhabit the warp. Tainted Psykers are humans that have been driven mad by constant exposure to these influences. They can explode with warp power, creating portals that allow daemons to be summoned, or they can use their powers to protect themselves from enemy fire.<\/li><li>Chaos Drone: A large daemon-possessed aerial drone that possesses a heavy autocannon, these drones provide aerial support to the forces of Chaos. They can detect enemies behind any cover. The drone is a manifestation of the warp that is part flesh, part metal, and pure evil.<\/li><li>Bloodletter Daemon: The Daemonic servants of the Chaos god Khorne. They are summoned directly from the warp and their very presence is enough to strike fear and despair into the hearts of men. They wield vicious swords which can rend through the armor of even a Space Marine and they fight in packs which can 'warp' from location to location.<\/li><li>Chaos Lord: Lords are the most powerful of all their Chaos Space Marine brethren.

There are three classes you can choose from on the side of the loyal Space marines or the traitorous Chaos Space Marines. You can gain experience in gameplay by getting kills and assists which will allow you to gain levels. There are also challenges associated with different weapons and will unlock perks for weapons or armor pieces to customize your space marine with. In the competitive multilplayer, there will be two different game modes. The first will be annihilation, which will be a standard team death match, with the winning team being whoever has the most kills. The second will be seize ground, in which the two teams will battle over objectives on the field that give points, and whichever team gains the most points will win.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/72451\/1843742-space_marine_tatical.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1843742\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/72451\/1843742-space_marine_tatical.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1843742\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/7\/72451\/1843742-space_marine_tatical.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Customization Options for the Tactical Marine class<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Multiplayer Classes:<\/p><ul><li>Tactical Marine\/Chaos Space Marine: The Tactical Marine is a well-rounded soldier, able to competently fight in both fire fights and melee combat.

The team that captured it successfully would have one of their team members spawned as the mighty Dreadnought and this team would be tasked with controlling a series of capture points placed around the map, while the other team would be tasked with destroying the Dreadnought. Once the dreadnought is destroyed, both teams resuming fighting over the central capture point again. Also included in this pack were 3 new maps, titled Desolation, Dome Mechanicus and Chem Refinery. The DLC pack costs 800 Microsoft Points, or $9.99.<\/p><p style=\"\">Along side this premium DLC, THQ also released a new game mode, entitled Capture and Control. This mode is similar to King of the Hill modes in many other games, tasking teams to capture and then defend points on the map. There were also two new player skins released alongside these packs, which represent the Iron Hands chapter and Death Guard legion. These player skins cost 240 Microsoft Points or $2.99 each.<\/p><h2>Official Soundtrack<\/h2><p style=\"\">The musical score was made by Cris Velasco and Sascha Dikiciyan.<\/p><ol><li>Prologue<\/li><li>Titus' Theme<\/li><li>Prelude To War<\/li><li>Against All Odds<\/li><li>Valkyrie Run<\/li><li>Battlements<\/li><li>Whispers Of The Dead<\/li><li>The Blood Ravens<\/li><li>Reunion With Mira<\/li><li>The Weirdboy<\/li><li>No Man's Land<\/li><li>The Inquisitor<\/li><li>The Meat Grinder<\/li><li>Heart Of Darkness<\/li><li>Fight For Honor<\/li><li>Titan<\/li><li>Legions Of Chaos<\/li><li>Heresy<\/li><li>A Hero's Legacy<\/li><\/ol><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum<\/h3><ul><li><b>OS<\/b>: Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1, Windows 7<\/li><li><b>Processor<\/b>: 2.0Ghz Dual core CPU (any Core 2 Duo or AMD x2 or better)<\/li><li><b>Memory<\/b>: 1GB (xp), 2GB (Vista &amp; Windows 7)<\/li><li><b>Graphics<\/b>: 256MB Video Card using Shader Model 3 (Nvidia GeForce 8800GT, AMD Radeon 3850 and above)<\/li><li><b>Hard Drive<\/b>: 20 GB space free (10 GB free after install)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Recommended<\/h3><ul><li><b>OS<\/b>: Windows 7<\/li><li><b>Processor<\/b>: Any Quad-core Intel or AMD Processor<\/li><li><b>Memory<\/b>: 1GB (xp), 2GB (Vista &amp; Windows 7)<\/li><li><b>Graphics<\/b>: 512MB Video Card using Shader Model 3 (Nvidia GT100\/200 series or better, AMD Radeon 5800 series or better)<\/li><li><b>Hard Drive<\/b>: 20 GB space free (10 GB free after install)<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1891361-box_wh40ksm.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1891361-box_wh40ksm.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1891361-box_wh40ksm.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1891361-box_wh40ksm.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1891361-box_wh40ksm.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1891361-box_wh40ksm.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1891361-box_wh40ksm.png"},"name":"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Sleeping Dogs, in its later stages developed at <a href=\"\/united-front-games\/3010-6705\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6705\">United Front Games<\/a> and eventually published by <a href=\"\/square-enix\/3010-104\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-104\">Square-Enix<\/a>, originally began life at <a href=\"\/activision\/3010-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision<\/a> as \"Black Lotus\", an open-world crime game with a female protagonist. However, under the belief that their predominantly male target audience would not play such a game starring a woman, management demanded that the protagonist be replaced with a man, and further tied the previously-unrelated game into the then-abandoned <a href=\"\/true-crime\/3025-257\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-257\">True Crime<\/a> franchise. However, due to factors such as the abysmal critical reception and sales of the last True Crime game, <a href=\"\/true-crime-new-york-city\/3030-3345\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3345\">True Crime: New York City<\/a>, and concerns over how the game would perform in the current market, the game underwent a turbulent development cycle. Initially, the game was developed at <a href=\"\/luxoflux-corp\/3010-1929\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1929\">Luxoflux<\/a>, but Activision halted development, only to restart the project at United Front Games. The game was initially entitled simply \"True Crime\", and then changed to \"True Crime: Hong Kong\".<\/p><p style=\"\">Activision cancelled the title a second time in February of 2011, and the game was subsequently picked up by Square-Enix, who made the announcement on August 1st, 2011. However, because Square-Enix did not purchase the True Crime intellectual property, the game was forced to undergo one final name change. On February 8th, 2012, Square-Enix officially announced that development had been resumed, and that the game had been renamed \"Sleeping Dogs\". The game was released on August 14, 2012 in the US and August 17th, 2012 in Europe and Australia.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game tells the story of <a href=\"\/wei-shen\/3005-14298\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14298\">Wei Shen<\/a>, an Chinese-American cop who is transferred to Hong Kong to infiltrate the Triads. According to the developers, he's based off Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie <i>The Departed<\/i>, which was in turn a remake of a Hong Kong movie entitled <i>Infernal Affairs<\/i>. They wanted to make a hero who got hit a lot and didn't seem invincible.<\/p><p style=\"\">During an undercover operation Wei is arrested and taken to a holding cell where he meets an old friend, Jackie Ma, who offers Wei a job and a possible in with the Sun On Yee family. After a meeting with the Hong Kong Police Inspector, Wei agrees to take the offer in order to infiltrate the Triads, sinking deep into the machinations of one of the world's most notorious criminal organizations. Initially, Wei has to prove himself to the Sun On Yee that he is not a cop, but earns their trust. However, being arrested again, Wei is introduced to Inspector <a href=\"\/jane-teng\/3005-25876\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25876\">Jane Teng<\/a>, whom he agrees to help with various investigations around the city outside of his undercover operation.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game was revealed to the press at GDC 2010. In the demo given, <a href=\"\/united-front-games\/3010-6705\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6705\">United Front<\/a> emphasized their focus on recreating the sort of action seen in Hong Kong action movies. That means that a big focus of the game will be put on melee combat and environmental moves, in combination with the game's take on <a href=\"\/parkour\/3015-272\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-272\">parkour<\/a> and free-running. The game's shooting will feature both feature a manual mode and a lock-on system, since a lock-on system will be easier to use in combination with the <a href=\"\/parkour\/3015-272\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-272\">free-running<\/a> and melee elements. Since there are former <a href=\"\/ea-black-box\/3010-1639\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1639\">Black Box<\/a> employees at <a href=\"\/united-front-games\/3010-6705\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6705\">United Front Games<\/a>, the driving in the game will be very similar to the <a href=\"\/need-for-speed\/3025-483\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-483\">Need for Speed<\/a> series of games.<\/p><p style=\"\">Playing as Wei Shen the player completes various missions from both sides of the law. Depending on how you complete your mission plays a huge part on how much experience you gain from the police and triad. By completing police missions, lessening nearby environment destruction, and reducing the amount of innocent civilians killed will result in an increase to your police xp. As compared to completing triad missions and defeating your opposition in brutal ways such as environment kills will increase your triad xp. As players gain more police xp and triad xp they are given ability points which allow players to customize their players skills.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278795\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/12565\/2278795-sd_0047.jpg\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/12565\/2278795-sd_0047.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2278795\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/12565\/2278795-sd_0047.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Fights mostly involve melee combat<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game has on foot, free-running sequences. In these sequences, the player is chasing a criminal. As a Wei runs, he pushes people out of the way and vaults over objects. Hong Kong has been mapped in such a way that it's adapted to the game play. During these chase sequences, the player will engage in hand-to-hand combat. Wei can use his fists, as well as weapons such as knives, meat cleavers and the environment. Enemies can be pushed into TVs, have their faces run against vents and and be thrown from rooftops. The game also has a counter system where an enemy flashes red to indicate when a counter can be performed.<\/p><p style=\"\">The melee combat is reminiscent of <a href=\"\/batman-arkham-asylum\/3030-23245\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\">Batman: Arkham Asylum<\/a> and <a href=\"\/batman-arkham-city\/3030-29443\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29443\">Batman: Arkham City<\/a>, bringing a similar timing and counter based approach to fights. The main attack button can be done in normal and heavy versions by tapping or holding to button, the counter button can (and should) be hit when an enemy is highlighted red, and the grapple button allows you to grab most enemies. Once grappled you can punch, throw, drag, or preform a variety of environmental attacks, which range from throwing in a dumpster to shoving a persons head into an incinerator. Wei also has the ability to lock onto enemies which allows for more precise and creative attack patterns. A specific side quest allows Wei to learn more combos to help him take down foes in even more ways.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2293622\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48227\/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48227\/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2293622\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/4\/48227\/2293622-screen_shot_2012_08_15_at_8.45.30_am.png\"><\/a><figcaption>The skill tree allows Wei to unlock new moves<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game incorporates the <a href=\"\/cell-phone\/3055-342\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-342\">cell phone<\/a> function that has become a feature in many open world games, most notably <a href=\"\/grand-theft-auto-iv\/3030-20457\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20457\">GTA IV<\/a>. Using his phone Wei can call contacts (Triad Members, Girls, Police handlers, etc) to gain access to side\/miscellaneous quests. There is also a text feature, but it always sends scripted messages that are used in the context of a mission. Wei can access the variety of CI Reports, Background info, and surveillance gatherings through the reports tab, access the social hub, and during some missions take pictures.<\/p><p style=\"\">One of the key features of the game is known as Face. It has several passive advantages to help the player outside of combat, such as making consumables last longer, discounts, and additional contacts, but it is most obvious in combat. Dealing damage (it seems that more impressive attacks\/counters will help more) will fill up the Face Meter, and once it is filled up, Wei regenerates health, intimidates enemies, and through unlocks gains additional advantages such as unblockable attacks and reduced damage. Face is upgraded through side missions and goes to level 10.<\/p><h2>Delayed, Dead, and Delivered<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1399328\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2164\/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2164\/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1399328\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/2164\/1399328-truecrime_screenshot05_1600.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The game in its True Crime days<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In 2009, shortly after <a href=\"\/activision\/3010-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision<\/a> put the old <a href=\"\/true-crime\/3025-257\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-257\">True Crime<\/a> moniker on it, the game was delayed through 2011.

Unreal Tournament 3 brings the multiplayer-focused <a data-ref-id=\"3025-240\" href=\"\/unreal-tournament\/3025-240\/\"> franchise<\/a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-86\" href=\"\/unreal-engine-3\/3015-86\/\"> Unreal Engine 3<\/a> while featuring a story-based single-player campaign (in which the player fills the shoes of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4390\" href=\"\/reaper\/3005-4390\/\"> Reaper<\/a>, one of the remaining few survivors of a colony world attacked by the Necris, in his quest for revenge), a grittier art style (reminiscent of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"\/gears-of-war\/3025-565\/\"> Gears of War<\/a> franchise), a new 1-on-1 Deathmatch mode with a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6216\" href=\"\/queue\/3015-6216\/\"> queuing system<\/a> (for multiple players), and an enhanced version of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13286\" href=\"\/unreal-tournament-2004\/3030-13286\/\"> Unreal Tournament 2004's<\/a> Onslaught mode (called Warfare mode).<\/p><h2>Game Modes<\/h2><h3>Deathmatch<\/h3><p style=\"\">Kill as many players as possible until a time limit or kill limit is reached.<\/p><h3>Team Deathmatch<\/h3><p style=\"\">Kill as many players as possible until a time limit or kill limit is reached. All the players are divided into two teams. Kills from each player are added together for a team score.<\/p><h3>Capture the Flag<\/h3><p style=\"\">A team based mode where one team needs to take the opposing flag and return it to their home base. This mode features the <a href=\"..\/..\/translocater\/93-735\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Translocator<\/a>, which allows you to teleport around the map.<\/p><h3>Vehicle Capture the Flag<\/h3><p style=\"\">The same mode as Capture the Flag, but with vehicles. You will have a <a href=\"..\/..\/hoverboard\/93-1746\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hoverboard<\/a>, instead of the Translocator, in this game mode.<\/p><h3>Duel<\/h3><p style=\"\">A One vs. One mode. A group of players enter a queue and are matched up against each other. The winner remains in the game for the next round but the loser is moved back to the end of the queue.<\/p><h3>Warfare<\/h3><p style=\"\"><i>Formerly known as Onslaught.<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\">Two teams are set into a map with the mission to capture nodes spread across the map. This mode includes vehicles, and is won by linking all the required nodes together, to destroy the opposing team's core. Should the time limit run out, the game will be taken into \"Overtime\", where both cores drain health at a rate depending on the amount of nodes that are controlled. Warfare also features nodes which do not need to be linked, but can be captured to bring in extra vehicles for the team or damage the enemy's core without having to link to it. One of the new things they added from the previous Onslaught mode is the Orb. Each team have a orb which can be picked up by a player. When a player carrying the orb is near one of his own power nodes, the node becomes invulnerable. If a player carrying the orb is walking into a contested or enemy controlled power node, that node will instantly be captured. If the player carrying the orb gets killed, the orb will be dropped on the ground and will stay there untill either; a player from the same team picks it up, a player from the opposing team sacrifices him\/herself to get rid of the orb, or the time limit passes so the orb despawns. <i>Most<\/i> Warfare maps are played on gigantic and gorgeous outdoor terrains.<\/p><h3>Greed<\/h3><p style=\"\"><i>Added in The Titan Pack.<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\">Players collect skulls dropped by defeated players. Players will then take these collected skulls and turn them in on a platform inside the enemy's base. Scoring 1 point for each skull turned in. The player is instantly teleported back to their own base after scoring. There are three kinds of skulls: Silver is worth 1 point, Gold is worth 5 points, and Red is worth 20 points.<\/p><p style=\"\">Greed can be played on all Capture the Flag and Vehicle Capture the Flag maps.<\/p><h3>Betrayal<\/h3><p style=\"\"><i>Added in The Titan Pack.<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\">Betrayal is basically Deathmatch with <a href=\"..\/..\/instagib\/92-402\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> instagib rifles<\/a>, however, there will be a period of time, where 2 random players will team-up to kill as many as possible (there can be multiple teams at the same time). These players' kills will be thrown into a pot, and the person who betray a team member first, will get this pot added to their score. If you'll wait a long time before you betray your teammate, the pot will be bigger, but also increasing the chance of being betrayed yourself. If you get Betrayed, you can get Retribution by killing the player who betrayed you, and by doing that scoring the points he stole from you. The Instagib Rifle has two firing modes: primary fire will let you kill neutral players with a red beam, while the secondary fire will be able to betray your teammates with a blue beam.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Weapon<\/th><th>Description<\/th><th>Appearance<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b><a href=\"..\/..\/translocater\/93-735\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Translocator<\/a><\/b><\/td><td>This weapon is only available in Capture the Flag.

Here's a rundown of what you can expect from each of them:<\/b><\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\"><b><i>Hostile (Warfare)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Many research vessels were lost in the early days of Na Pali exploration. When the terrain or local fauna proved to be too dangerous for recovery, equipment was often abandoned and forgotten. But when it was learned that the Necris had moved in to recover this equipment for their own purposes, the NEG dispatched military salvage units to reclaim their property.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Confrontation (Warfare)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Confrontation Canyon serves as a training ground for Axon forces, improving unit readiness by providing highly realistic, stressful training across the full spectrum of infantry and mechanized conflict. It is the premiere facility for heavy armor training, and all forces must complete courses here before assignment to a Leviathan unit.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Cold Harbor (Warfare)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Axon's Stealth Research Division managed to get some of the early specs for the Necris Nightshade vehicle and have been attempting to retrofit that technology onto their own. The Necris have moved to stop this research, and despite the blockade that sealed the harbor when the NEG enforced the armistice, they have maintained a foothold here and are fervently working to destroy all remaining Axon research.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Downtown_Necris (Warfare)<\/i><\/b><br \/>The Necris are invading territories throughout Taryd, infecting conquered areas with Nanoblack to terraform them to suit their own needs. You must push back the Necris forces and restore order to this sector.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Stranded (Vehicle CTF)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Civilian contractors are often used to reliably transport supplies and equipment over short distances on Taryd, but when this cargo ship full of Axon supplies ran aground in Izanagi territory, a military unit was quickly dispatched to defend the area until a full extraction team could be assembled.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Rails (Vehicle CTF)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Even areas of new construction can be exploited as weak points in Oxida Nova's defenses, so the Iron Guard has established a series of mobile turrets to patrol the perimeter of this worksite. With several city blocks of terrain to cover, including an access point through the city's canal system, protecting this site will be a challenge to even the most experienced of teams.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Suspense_Necris (Vehicle CTF)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Suspense is the only bridge across the Alluvion strong enough to support the weight of heavy combat vehicles. It is under attack by Necris forces that control one river bank.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Dark Match (Deathmatch)<\/i><\/b><br \/>In preparation for the assault on Oxida Nova, Izanagi bombers targeted supply lines and other sites of important infrastructure. This power station was one of the first to be hit, and is now left to defend itself while running only on auxiliary reserves. Attack forces have moved in, and the facility's lights haven't even been restored. This level provides a unique twist on deathmatch in a darkened laboratory lit intermittently by a particle accelerator and emergency lights, and by muzzle flashes and explosions.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Ocean Relic (Deathmatch)<\/i><\/b><br \/>This ancient structure was discovered in the depths of an ocean rift 53 miles off the southern coast of Absalom. While the planet's seemingly endless supply of sentient Nanoblack has kept the facility active, its origins and ultimate purpose remain a mystery. This level features the slow field powerup, a portable version of the slow field deployable.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Eden, Inc. (Deathmatch)<\/i><\/b><br \/>This industrial complex was once a hydroponic research facility focused on saving rare and endangered species. When their grant ran out, funds dried up and all work was suspended. Months later, demo crews moved in to pave the path for a new highway and found that many of the research seedlings had taken root and continued to grow. This level features the introduction of deployables to deathmatch, with both a spidermine trap and an X-Ray field deployable available.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Turbine (Deathmatch)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Axon Research Corporation has many geothermal power stations just like this scattered across the northern reaches of Taryd. They form a tight grid that supplies power to the research facilities and military installations common to the area. This level features the return of a classic Unreal Tournament deathmatch layout.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Koos Barge (Deathmatch)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Continuing their long tradition of expertly crafted sea vessels, Koos Shipping now offers barge services across all of Taryd's oceans and waterways. While the prices are exorbitant, they're the only line that guarantees that your shipment will arrive on time and undamaged, even when shipping lanes take them across the frozen polar regions.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Lost Cause (Deathmatch)<\/i><\/b><br \/>The Necris have not revealed the original purpose of this crumbling structure, nor have they explained why it was decommissioned. It stands on the cliffs of Absalom as a monument to history, a living link to the Necris ancestors.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Morbid (CTF)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Morbias Station Gamma is a transport hub that services overflow traffic passing through Taryd's jumpgates. The Station offers a terrestrial shuttle, storage facilities (with quarantine services for live cargo), and a social center where guests can meet incoming visitors or hold private meetings in a neutral setting. Designed for use with the Titan mutator, Morbid includes heavy blast doors that can only be operated by Titans.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Nanoblack (CTF)<\/i><\/b><br \/>Giant vats of Nanoblack are processed and stored in facilities like this one across Omicron. The structures are largely self-sustaining once operational, and are upheld with much reverence by those who respect the power and significance of the Nanoblack seething within. Public access is highly restricted.<br \/><br \/><b><i>Shaft (CTF)<\/i><\/b><br \/>The substrata mines of Taryd produced over 800 gigatons of Tarydium last year alone. Production never stops here, not even for war, and mining drones will remain operational even as chaos erupts around them.<\/p><\/blockquote><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><h3>Disc One<\/h3><table

<a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a> and <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3<\/a> and was released on March 25, 2008 through <a href=\"\/d3-publisher-inc\/3010-895\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-895\">D3 Publisher<\/a>. It was released on the <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> a year later, published by <a href=\"\/aspyr-media-inc\/3010-388\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-388\">Aspyr Media<\/a>. Originally planned to feature a sci-fi setting with the main character being a man in an advanced armored suit, it was later changed to a more realistic setting in military bases, abandoned towns, and other grittier environments . The developers stated that this was because of other developers and publishers shifting their attention to more realistic settings. Gameplay revolves around <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover<\/a>, third-person shooting, and the use of a bladed projectile weapon called the <a href=\"\/glaive\/3055-927\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-927\">glaive<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The glaive can be used at the same time as one-handed guns. Throwing the glaive can stun enemies, setting them up for melee finishing moves; with enough accumulated damage, the glaive can also dismember foes, killing them immediately even if only a limb is severed. Hayden's disease mutates over time, resulting in new abilities as the story progresses. One of these new powers is the ability to perform charged up \"power throws\". These power throws will decapitate most minor enemies in one hit. Soon after learning power throws, Hayden obtains \"aftertouch\", allowing him to directly control the path of the glaive in mid-flight. The glaive can also absorb the \"elements\" such as fire, ice, and electricity for improved combat abilities as well as involvement in the game's <a href=\"\/puzzles\/3015-932\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzle-solving<\/a>. It also serves as a boomerang, capable of collecting items that are too far for Hayden to reach.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is also a heavy amount of gunplay. The shooting is reminiscent of <a href=\"\/gears-of-war\/3030-12231\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War<\/a>, with a similar <a href=\"\/over-the-shoulder\/3015-2621\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder<\/a> perspective and <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover system<\/a>. However, there is no <a href=\"\/blind-fire\/3015-612\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-612\">blind fire<\/a>, increasing the importance of the glaive because it is capable of killing enemies while Hayden is still taking cover. There are also collectible upgrades throughout the game's chapters, which can be added to the guns during visits to the black market. Upgrades are permanent and take up limited slots on each gun.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\">The story begins with <a href=\"\/\">Hayden Tenno<\/a>, an operative from an unnamed United States agency (the game's multiplayer simply refers to it as \"The Agency\"), on a mission in the fictional Eastern European nation of Lasria. He possesses a disease called congenital analgia which mostly nullifies his ability to feel pain. Hayden kills a captured U.S. agent named Viktor, because he is believed to be infected by the Technocyte Virus, a disease that transforms its victims into powerful abominations, and then pursues a man named <a href=\"\/robert-mezner\/3005-9137\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9137\">Mezner<\/a>. Mezner is the man responsible for unleashing the virus in the first place. The mutation process is so painful that it usually drives the infected insane. As Hayden tracks down Mezner, he meets the Nemesis, an imposing, gladiator-esque creature in an armoured suit. After a brief fight Hayden is defeated and infected, but due to his disease, he does not feel the agonizing pain to the extent that others do, and so he is not driven into madness. He remains mostly in control of himself and his thoughts, able to use the disease to his advantage. Hayden sets out to find Mezner and stop the spread of the virus.<\/p><h2>Levels<\/h2><ul><li>Prologue<\/li><li>Exposure<\/li><li>Baggage Claim<\/li><li>Moths to the Flame<\/li><li>The Shipment<\/li><li>The Bait<\/li><li>Industrial Evolution<\/li><li>Unnatural History<\/li><li>Threshold Guardian<\/li><li>The Dark Sector<\/li><\/ul><h2>Characters<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/727\/398833-dark_sector_art_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398833\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/727\/398833-dark_sector_art_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398833\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/727\/398833-dark_sector_art_04.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><b>Hayden Tenno<\/b>:<\/p><p style=\"\">Dark Sector's protagonist who is infected with the Technocyte virus, giving him his unique in game abilities, is out to stop the spread of the virus across the world<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11097\/850893-menzer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-850893\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11097\/850893-menzer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-850893\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11097\/850893-menzer.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><b>Robert Mezner:<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Dark Sector's <a href=\"\/antagonist\/3015-1070\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1070\">antagonist<\/a> is also infected with the Technocyte virus.

Although it does not shrink it past the guns normal maximum accuracy point. Using your glaive with after touch completely removes the necessity of this upgrade.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>2: Double Shot<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Everything<\/p><p style=\"\">The Double Shot upgrade makes each gun fire twice in one shot. This upgrade can be deadly when used with a shotgun or magnum weapon.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>3: Fire Rate<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Everything<\/p><p style=\"\">This upgrade does exactly what is sounds like it would do. It increases the firing speed of a weapon. It helps on slower pistols and shotguns, but generally is not necessarily needed.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>4: Reload Speed<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Everything<\/p><p style=\"\">Reload Speed allows you to reload your weapon faster then normal. Except for the fact that Hayden already reloads all of his guns at a fast pace, it would be a better idea to just sell this upgrade for money.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>5: Puncture<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Magnum<\/p><p style=\"\">This allows bullets to pass through an enemy and into one directly behind him. This upgrade is generally pointless when you have your glaive that can do the same thing for free. It would again be a better idea to sell this upgrade instead of using it.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>6: Stopping Power<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Shotgun, Magnum<\/p><p style=\"\">This upgrade allows your shots to knock enemies over allowing you to shoot them more. This upgrade does not cause any more damage to the enemy.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>7: Enferon Shells<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Everything<\/p><p style=\"\">Enferon Shells are a rare upgrade in the game and should be used carefully. The upgrade coats your ammunition in Enferon and is highly affective on the infected. A few shots will cause them to swell up and die of convulsions (after around 10 seconds).<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>8: Clip Extender<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Everything<\/p><p style=\"\">This upgrade will extend your ammo capacity by 25%. On longarms it is stackable up to 100% (using four upgrades) and on sidearms only to 75%. The only exception to this rule as pointed out by others is the Spectre which only gets one extra shell.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>9: Firepower<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Everything<\/p><p style=\"\">Firepower is an extremley rare upgrade with only four scattered through the game. They will increase the firepower strength of your weapon.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>10: Upgrade Slot<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Available to: Everything<\/p><p style=\"\">The rarest upgrade in the game which can only be found in timed levels of the game. It allows you to add one more upgrade slot to your weapon of choice (if that weapon is not already maxed out in upgrade slots).<\/p><h2>Technocyte Powers (Special Abilities)<\/h2><p style=\"\"><b>1: Steal \/ Grab<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Achieved in: Chapter Two<\/p><p style=\"\">Allows Hayden to use the glaive to grab items from a distance by throwing it at them.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>2: Power Throw<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Achieved in: Chapter Three<\/p><p style=\"\">Allows the glaive to break special chains and locks. It also kills most enemies in one hit.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>3: After Touch<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Achieved in: Chapter Three<\/p><p style=\"\">Lets the player control the movement of the glaive in slow motion.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>4: Shield<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Achieved in: Chapter Four<\/p><p style=\"\">Generates a shield in front of Hayden which blocks most all attacks and deflects <a href=\"\/projectile\/3015-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3\">projectiles<\/a> back in his facing direction.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>5: Energy Pulse<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Achieved in: Chapter Five<\/p><p style=\"\">Allows Hayden to create an energy explosion with the glaive when it is thrown and charged with any elemental power (fire, electricity, and ice).<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>6: Shift \/ Invisibility<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Achieved in: Chapter Seven<\/p><p style=\"\">Turns Hayden invisible for a short period of time, allowing for stealth kills and bypassing some security systems. Invisibility automatically ends when the player attacks.<\/p><h2>Reclassification In Australia<\/h2><p style=\"\">On Feburary 18th, 2008, Dark Sector was refused classification by the Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification board (OFLC), due to the games high-impact level of violence, and deemed unsuitable for audiences under the age of 18 years old. The OFLC stated:<\/p><blockquote data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"center\"><p style=\"\">\"The finishing moves and most violent game play includes decapitation, dismemberment of limbs accompanied by large blood spurts, neck breaking spurts, neck breaking twists and exploded bodies with post-action twitching body parts. These moves are relatively easy to accomplish and once the player has mastered the moves and is able to get close to his foes, these violent moves can be executed... Successfully shooting an opponent results in the depiction of blood spray. When Hayden cuts off his opponent's limb with the glaive, large amounts of blood spray forth from the stump and the injured person screams in agony which increases the impact.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p style=\"\">Dark Sector was later reclassified with MA15+ classification and released in Australia on October 9th 2008. Featuring no decapitations and toned down dismemberment on human opponents. This heavily censored version was based on the Japanese version, which was also slightly sanitised before its release. <\/p><h2>HDD Installation<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>Dark Sector<\/i> requires 1.3 GB of installation space for the <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3<\/a> version and an optional 1.3GB of space to install for the <a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a> version.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><ul><li><b>Operating System<\/b> Windows XP SP3, Vista SP1<\/li><li><b>CPU<\/b> Intel Dual Core 2.0 Ghz or AMD Athlon 4000<\/li><li><b>Memory<\/b> XP- 1 GB, Vista 2 GB<\/li><li><b>Hard Drive Space<\/b> 6.1 GB; 1 GB swap file<\/li><li><b>Sound Card<\/b> Directx 9.0 compatible<\/li><li><b>Video Card<\/b> ATI Radeon X1600, Nvidia Geforce 7600<\/li><li><b>Media Required<\/b> 6x DVD-ROM drive<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/1\/14036\/824169-dark_sector_cover.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14036\/824169-dark_sector_cover.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/1\/14036\/824169-dark_sector_cover.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14036\/824169-dark_sector_cover.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/1\/14036\/824169-dark_sector_cover.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/1\/14036\/824169-dark_sector_cover.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/1\/14036\/824169-dark_sector_cover.jpg"},"name":"Dark Sector"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Silent Hill: Homecoming is the sixth installment of <a href=\"..\/..\/konami-corporation\/65-87\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Konami<\/a>'s popular <a href=\"..\/..\/survival-horror\/92-4801\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> survival horror<\/a> series.

Alex begins a search for his brother between his hometown and the fog-covered supernatural town of <a href=\"..\/..\/silent-hill\/95-67\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Silent Hill<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The gameplay is focused on a mix of exploration and combat. The player advances through the story by fighting the grotesque monsters that reside in Silent Hill, resolving <a href=\"..\/..\/puzzles\/92-932\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> puzzles<\/a>, searching for items and clues, and occasionally selecting responses when branching conversation trees appear during certain encounters in the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game utilizes Alex's military training, in the form of gameplay mechanics such as evasive movement and <a href=\"..\/..\/grapple\/92-1622\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> grapples<\/a>. Alex and his enemies also have real-time wounds appear on them as they take damage. Objects in the world have realistic physics, so if Alex bumps into a <a href=\"..\/..\/table\/93-282\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> table<\/a>, the table and any objects on it will move and make noise. This sort of carelessness will alert enemies to Alex's location. The game employs new fighting mechanics, including the abilities to dodge enemies and analog swing weapons, greatly improving the combat over other games in the series. Homecoming was also drastically updated in the visual aspect of the game, appropriate since the last console game in the series, <a href=\"..\/..\/silent-hill-4-the-room\/61-6328\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Silent Hill 4: The Room<\/a>, was on the <a href=\"..\/..\/playstation-2\/60-19\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Playstation 2<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">In addition, the game has five <a href=\"..\/..\/multiple-endings\/92-27\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> endings<\/a> and bonus <a href=\"..\/..\/alternate-costumes\/92-583\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> costumes<\/a>, which can be unlocked finishing the game once under any <a href=\"..\/..\/difficulty-level\/92-183\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> difficulty setting<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Plot <\/h2><p style=\"\">After waking from a <a href=\"..\/..\/nightmare\/92-3702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> nightmare<\/a> (which foreshadows the main plot of the game), Alex Shepherd finds himself in his hometown of Shepherd's Glen. He has returned to the town after time in the military. The town he returned to is nothing like the one he remembers though. A strange <a href=\"..\/..\/fog\/92-904\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> fog<\/a> has settled over the town and monsters walk the streets. He returns home to find his mother (<a href=\"\/lillian-shepherd\/3005-13497\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13497\"> Lillian<\/a>) in a near-catatonic state. When he questions her about his younger brother <a href=\"..\/..\/joshua-shepherd\/94-13498\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Joshua<\/a> she replies that his father went looking for him and that \"he's gone, everyone's gone\". Investigating the <a href=\"..\/..\/cemetery\/95-1552\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> graveyard<\/a> reveals the Mayor's behaving strangely. He is digging a grave in the cemetery and is unapproachable. Conversation with <a href=\"\/elle-hollaway\/3005-7888\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7888\"> Elle Holloway<\/a> (a childhood friend) reveals that people have gone missing from the town and nothing is how Alex remembers it. After acquiring a firearm from <a href=\"..\/..\/curtis-ackers\/94-13502\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Curtis Ackers<\/a>, Alex goes in search of <a href=\"..\/..\/mayor-bartlett\/94-13501\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mayor Bartlett<\/a>. Alex enters the Bartlett family tomb and finds a watch with no hands. The ticking of the watch causes Alex to pass out. When he wakes he finds himself in the town of Silent Hill. Entering the Grand Hotel he eventually finds the Mayor in the <a href=\"..\/..\/otherworld\/92-6053\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> otherworld<\/a> babbling about his son Joey and how Adam Shepard (the Sheriff and Alex's father) failed to protect the town. Upon being presented with the broken watch the Mayor discards it, inadvertently angering the monstrosity that serves as the game's first boss, a fleshy mass named Sepulcher. Upon defeating the boss Alex falls into the hole Sepulcher creates.<\/p><p style=\"\">Alex regains consciousness in the Shepherd's Glen prison where he meets <a href=\"..\/..\/deputy-wheeler\/94-13499\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Deputy Wheeler<\/a>. Upon convincing Wheeler of innocence he is released. The police station is then attacked by monsters. Elle then contacts Alex to tell him to meet her. Alex and Wheeler become separated and Alex eventually makes his way to the Parking lot where Elle is waiting for him in a car. They are attacked and escape to the sewers. In the sewers Elle and Alex become separated. Upon emerging Alex goes in search of Dr. Finch as Wheeler advised him to. He finds the doctor covered in blood outside his office. The doctor then runs away and Alex follows. After touching a doll that belongs to <a href=\"..\/..\/scarlet\/92-6112\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Scarlet Finch<\/a> (Dr. Finch's daughter) Alex is transported to the otherworld. Here he begins a descent into a industrial nightmare. Here he finds Dr. Finch shirtless and bleeding from multiple self inflicted lacerations. When confronted by Alex the doctor begins a deranged rant about his daughter. Alex presents the doctor with the doll found earlier. As with the mayor this causes a boss to appear. The games second boss, Scarlet is a giant demonic porcelain doll that kills Dr. Finch and then proceeds to engage Alex in combat. When damaged the porcelain skin breaks and the doll bleeds profusely. This is symbolic and crucial to the games plot. Upon its death Alex sinks into the blood pooling out from the dolls corpse and returns to Shepherd's Glen.<\/p><p style=\"\">Alex finds himself back in the room that he found the doll as if nothing had happened. The doll lies broken on the floor and Alex finds a key that was hidden in the body of the doll. This key opens a secret chamber in the Town Hall and Alex discovers a cult shrine devoted to deities that are associated with the town of Silent Hill. Alex returns home with this information, searching for clues about his families involvement with the cult. Alex discovers that Joshua was treated specially by his family and that he was ignored for a reason. He finds a letter from his father and a map of Silent Hill. This opens up more questions and Alex questions his mother about Silent Hill. Before she can answer him she is abducted and Alex is beaten and left for dead. He wakes up in a otherworld version of his house and eventually escapes, meeting up with Wheeler and Elle. They take a boat across <a href=\"..\/..\/toluca-lake\/95-1391\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Toluca Lake<\/a>. They are ambushed by cultists and Alex falls into the lake in the scuffle.<\/p><p style=\"\">Alex is washed up on the lake shore and makes his way into Silent Hill. Along the way he is radioed by Wheeler and is told that both Wheeler and Elle are in the prison. In the prison Alex fights off cultists and finds his mother in a strange torture device. Here the player is forced to make a decision. Lillian begs Alex to kill her quickly before the device kills her slowly and painfully. The player must decided if they can make Alex kill his own mother. Once Lillian dies the prison undergoes a otherworld transition. In the otherworld Alex finds Elle and Wheeler. They find Judge Holloway in the prison as well. She abducts Elle who drops her locket which contains an image of her sister. The game's third boss Asphyxia drags Wheeler through a tunnel and then reappears to fight Alex. Judge Holloway locks Alex in the room, grinning.<\/p><p style=\"\">With the death of Asphyxia Alex escapes and finds himself in a church. Here he confronts his father twice. Once he finds his father in a confessional booth and has the option to forgive or curse him for his treatment of Alex. The second time they meet Adam is tied up and blocks Alex's progression. He is repentant and through the conversations the player discovers that Alex may not have been in the military at all. <a href=\"..\/..\/adam-shepherd\/94-8182\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Adam<\/a> seems to think that his son was in an insane asylum (referred to as a hospital) before the events of the game. Adam is then killed by <a href=\"..\/..\/pyramid-head\/94-2442\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Pyramid Head<\/a>, the vengeful spirit of Silent Hill.<\/p><p style=\"\">When Alex proceeds he finds that <a href=\"..\/..\/judge-holloway\/94-13496\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Judge Holloway<\/a> and Curtis are trying to kill him in order to save Shepherd's Glen from the wrath of the gods worshipped by the cult. Alex saves Elle and has the option to save Wheeler from Curtis. Leaving Elle with Wheeler Alex proceeds, determined to find out what happened to Joshua. As he descends he finds a tomb in which the four founding families of Shepherd's Glen have marked the sacrificed children's names. Searching for his families section of the tomb he finds that he was the one meant for sacrifice. This triggers a flashback in which Alex inadvertently kills Josh in an accident on Toluca lake. Having found the truth about what happened to Joshua he faces the final boss. A representation of the fourth ritual sacrifice, death by drowning.<\/p><p style=\"\">After defeating the boss the player receives one of the five endings for the game. These vary depending on the decisions made in the later stages of the game.<\/p><h2>Chapters<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game is divided in <b>12 Chapters<\/b>, those being:<\/p><ol><li>Nightmare<\/li><li>Missing Persons<\/li><li>Hotel<\/li><li>Sheriff's Station<\/li><li>Sewers<\/li><li>Hell Descent<\/li><li>Town Hall<\/li><li>The Attic<\/li><li>Dark Times<\/li><li>Prison<\/li><li>Church<\/li><li>Underground<\/li><\/ol><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><p style=\"\"><b>Minimum System Requirements<\/b><\/p><ul><li>OS: Windows XP\/Vista<\/li><li>Processor: Pentium 4 @ 2.8 GHz (3.2 GHz for Vista)<\/li><li>Memory: 1 GB<\/li><li>Hard Drive: 10 GB Free<\/li><li>Video Memory: 256 MB (nVidia GeForce 7800 GT\/ATI Radeon X1950)<\/li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible<\/li><li>DirectX: 9.0c<\/li><li>Keyboard &amp; Mouse<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><b>Recommended System Requirements<\/b><\/p><ul><li>OS: Windows XP\/Vista<\/li><li>Processor: Pentium 4 @ 2.8 GHz (3.2 GHz for Vista)<\/li><li>Memory: 2 GB<\/li><li>Hard Drive: 10 GB Free<\/li><li>Video Memory: 512 MB (nVidia GeForce 8800 GT\/ATI HD2900)<\/li><li>Sound Card: DirectX Compatible<\/li><li>DirectX: 9.0c or 10<\/li><li>Keyboard &amp; Mouse<\/li><\/ul><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p style=\"\">- All music composed by <a href=\"..\/..\/akira-yamaoka\/72-40927\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Akira Yamaoka<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">- Vocals on tracks 1, 6, 20, 21 by <a href=\"..\/..\/mary-elizabeth-mcglynn\/72-22864\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mary Elizabeth McGlynn<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\">- All lyrics by <a href=\"..\/..\/joe-romersa\/72-73904\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Joe Romersa.<\/a><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/16944\/1230115-shh_promo_ost_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1230115\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/16944\/1230115-shh_promo_ost_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1230115\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/16944\/1230115-shh_promo_ost_front.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Silent Hill: Homecoming OST<\/figcaption><\/figure><ol><li>One More Soul To The Call<\/li><li>Witchcraft<\/li><li>Mr. JOY<\/li><li>Cold Blood<\/li><li>The Terminal Show<\/li><li>Elle Theme<\/li><li>4 Pattern<\/li><li>Snow Flower<\/li><li>Attitude #70<\/li><li>Regards<\/li><li>Total Invasion<\/li><li>The Real Love<\/li><li>Voodoo Girl<\/li><li>Living In Fear<\/li><li>Dreams of Leaving<\/li><li>Who Knows<\/li><li>Slave 2 Death<\/li><li>The Thing<\/li><li>Dead Monks<\/li><li>This Sacred Line<\/li><li>Alex Theme<\/li><\/ol><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/travis-grady\/94-1339\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Travis Grady<\/a>, the main character in <a href=\"..\/..\/silent-hill-0rigins\/61-14392\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Silent Hill: 0rigins<\/a>, makes a cameo in a cutscene as the truck driver that Alex hitched a ride home from.<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/1\/14036\/804802-silent_hill_homecoming_boxart.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14036\/804802-silent_hill_homecoming_boxart.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/1\/14036\/804802-silent_hill_homecoming_boxart.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14036\/804802-silent_hill_homecoming_boxart.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/1\/14036\/804802-silent_hill_homecoming_boxart.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/1\/14036\/804802-silent_hill_homecoming_boxart.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/1\/14036\/804802-silent_hill_homecoming_boxart.jpg"},"name":"Silent Hill: Homecoming"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>Indigo Prophecy<\/i> (or <i>Fahrenheit<\/i>, as it's known outside of North America) is an adventure game developed by <a href=\"\/quantic-dream\/3010-2005\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2005\">Quantic Dream<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/atari-inc\/3010-182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari<\/a>. <i>Indigo Prophecy's<\/i> core focus is making the gameplay feel like an interactive movie with sophisticated story.

Lucas, in a trance state, attacks and <a href=\"\/murder\/3015-1654\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1654\">murders<\/a> a fellow customer. Confused by what has just happened, Lucas flees the scene before his crime is discovered. Soon the diner is investigated by <a href=\"\/detective\/3015-1079\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1079\">detectives<\/a> <a href=\"\/carla-valenti\/3005-1473\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1473\">Carla Valenti<\/a> and <a href=\"\/tyler-miles\/3005-2770\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2770\">Tyler Miles<\/a>. It turns out that Lucas was possessed by <a href=\"\/the-oracle\/3005-11117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11117\">The Oracle<\/a> looking for Indigo Child. Indigo Child is a little girl with a perfectly pure soul who has never been incarnated, and thus she carries the secrets of life within her soul.<\/p><p style=\"\">In order to find the child, The Oracle goes around mind-controlling people and forcing them to kill other people according to an ancient ritual. While the victim is dying, The Oracle is able to peer through \"The Snake\" and see into the afterlife which lets him look for Indigo Child.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Oracle is looking for her and every time he wants a peek he has to arrange for somebody to kill somebody else. Lucas was exposed to a radioactive artifact in a military base when he was growing up, which filled him with The Chroma. The Chroma was dormant in his system for most of his life, only occasionally manifesting itself in the form of clairvoyant visions. After his contact with The Oracle, The Chroma gets stronger and he begins to get super-powers (which resemble The Matrix movies). His powers include <a href=\"\/wall-run\/3015-748\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-748\">Wall-running<\/a>, Kung Fu, <a href=\"\/bullet-time\/3015-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-78\">bullet-time<\/a>, <a href=\"\/super-jump\/3015-694\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-694\">super jumping<\/a>, and so forth. The oracle never stops pursuing Lucas at any cost. Throughout the game, Lucas is pursued by these detectives, which leads to the discovery of something more paranormal behind the murder. The detectives begin to notice other murders in the same vein with the same patterns. The story faces Lucas with the responsibility to fight for the safety of the world.<\/p><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, the temperature is dropping. At the start of the game, New York is in a period of unusually cold weather, but later the player becomes informed that the whole planet is freezing over in some cataclysm of ice and snow. The change is extremely abrupt.<\/p><p style=\"\">Lucas gets a phone call from his ex-girlfriend for a meeting. He then goes to an amusement park to save the life of his girlfriend, who was apparently kidnapped by The Oracle. Turns out this was a trap and Lucas and his ex-girlfriend later fall to their death. But surprisingly, we then see Undead Lucas (dark circles under his eyes, pale, gray hair, wrapped in bandages, and without body heat) team up with Detective Carla, at which point everything we know about her character is thrown out the window as she joins up with a (dead) wanted criminal to help him look for the aforementioned Indigo Child. Carla then falls in love with Lucas.<\/p><p style=\"\">Lucas rescues the Indigo Child, and has a huge battle against The Oracle. At the end Lucas runs away, and leaps into an apartment window at random trying to escape from The Oracle. Inside he meets yet another player in the battle for the child, the Purple Clan. The Purple Clan is a glowing yellow sentient AI who are after Indigo Child to capture the world. Lucas is led into the <a href=\"\/sewer\/3035-348\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-348\">sewers<\/a> by a new ally - The Invisibles. They're a group that has been fighting against the Orange Clan for thousands of years. Their members are all homeless people. They welcome Carla, Lucas, and the Indigo Child.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Indigo Child doesn't speak or act of her own volition. She doesn't act like a kid and nobody ever treats her like one. The Invisibles explain that the Orange Clan is a powerful organization that controls the world banks and governments. Carla and Lucas are later seen making love to each other.<\/p><p style=\"\">After that they get in a snowplow and drive Indigo child to the Midwest, where Lucas was originally exposed to The Chroma. Both the Purple Clan and the Orange Clan are waiting when they arrive.<\/p><p style=\"\">At this point, based on the player's actions, the Purple Clan, Orange Clan, or human race rule the world.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5322\/421071-indigo_prophecy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421071\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5322\/421071-indigo_prophecy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421071\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5322\/421071-indigo_prophecy_1.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The gameplay in <i>Indigo Prophecy<\/i> focuses on keeping a cinematic feel throughout the game. The game puts a strong focus on <a href=\"\/quick-time-event\/3015-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">quick time events<\/a> and in-game camera angles - notably, it uses \" split screen\" to play two separate scenes against one another (for example, a <a href=\"\/police-car\/3055-844\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-844\">police car<\/a> on its way to a crime scene and a character at that scene trying to get answers before the police arrive). The most notable gameplay aspect of <i>Indigo<\/i> is that the face buttons are rarely, if ever, used. Most of the game-play is focused on the right analog stick: the player moves the right analog stick in an approximation of the action to be performed (the available motions are displayed at the bottom of the screen).<\/p><p style=\"\">The game does a good job of remembering the players' actions in later story threads. Depending on your actions and what you say in the game, you can affect how things move throughout the plot. For example, in one sequence at the start of the game you have a choice of saving a boy who is drowning in a frozen lake or fleeing from a cop that will likely recognize you. If you save the boy you are recognized by a police officer who was at the diner. If you choose to let the child drown, Lucas' depression deepens.<\/p><p style=\"\"><i>Indigo Prophecy<\/i> has a mental health meter. This meter is affected by the actions you make in the world and the things you say when your interacting with characters. Most of the time, major events in the game will decrease your mental health - but you can raise the meter by doing normal daily activities (drinking, washing your hands, listening to music, etc.) When the mental health meter reaches zero, the player will be punished with a game-over screen and must restart from the last checkpoint. While interesting and innovative, Cage remarked that the mental health concept came into the design too late to be integrated significantly into the game's plot.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/390\/249983-79747_indigo_prophecy_20050727104818953.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249983\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/390\/249983-79747_indigo_prophecy_20050727104818953.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249983\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/390\/249983-79747_indigo_prophecy_20050727104818953.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Carla at gunpoint.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">You play as four different characters: Lucas Kane, Carla Valenti, Tyler Miles and occasionally <a href=\"\/markus-kane\/3005-7406\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7406\">Markus Kane<\/a>. The characters do not necessarily work for the same cause. This is especially present in some scenes - in one scene, the player must create a photo fit of Lucas Kane; depending on how similar the produced image is, later missions as Kane become more difficult.<\/p><p style=\"\">The final, and arguably most important, aspect of the gameplay is the dialogue. As with all other interactions, dialogues are performed on the right analog stick where you choose what you want to say by moving it up down left or right. The dialog has many different effects on the plot. Depending on what you say to people, it affects your mental health, with the meter going down if you interact in a negative way and the meter going up if you interact in a positive way. The dialog is also used in some interrogation scenes affecting the kind of information you get from the crime scene depending on what you ask. <i>Indigo Prophecy<\/i> features three endings.<\/p><h2>Changes to the North American version<\/h2><p style=\"\">In the <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States<\/a> and <a href=\"\/canada\/3035-244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-244\">Canada<\/a>, the game's title was changed from <i>Fahrenheit<\/i> to <i>Indigo Prophecy<\/i> to avoid confusion with the documentary movie <i>Fahrenheit 9\/11.<\/i> The <a href=\"\/nudity\/3015-1058\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1058\">nude<\/a> scenes featured in the game were also removed.

It went on to become the best selling <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2<\/a> game of all time and was praised by critics. It was later released on both <a href=\"\/xbox\/3045-32\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox<\/a> and <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto games, San Andreas actually takes place in an entire state rather than a city. The state is divided into three regions: Los Santos (based on <a href=\"\/los-angeles\/3035-490\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-490\">Los Angeles<\/a>), <a href=\"\/san-fierro\/3035-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-20\">San Fierro<\/a> (based on <a href=\"\/san-francisco\/3035-191\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-191\">San Francisco<\/a>), and <a href=\"\/las-venturas\/3035-18\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-18\">Las Venturas<\/a> (based on <a href=\"\/las-vegas\/3035-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-78\">Las Vegas<\/a>). San Andreas also has the most diverse setting in the series, with open countryside contrasting a variety of sprawling urban landscapes. In addition to the normal open-world gameplay, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/rpg-elements\/3015-3603\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3603\">role-playing elements<\/a> were introduced to the series in the form of <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/attributes\/3015-1681\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\">stats<\/a>, such as Muscle and Stamina.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">San Andreas introduced a number of significant gameplay changes. For the first time, the player has the ability to swim, addressing one of the key complaints lodged against previous GTA games. Several of the game's missions feature swimming and diving as a critical element.<\/p><h3>Visual customization<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/443\/361594-gallery30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-361594\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/443\/361594-gallery30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-361594\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/443\/361594-gallery30.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Remember kids, helicopters are explosive!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In addition to this, San Andreas allowed for major character customization. Clothing, hairstyles, and even the build of your character can all be changed, with a greater selection of stores being unlocked as you progress through the game. Players are required to eat food regularly to maintain their health, but eating too much junk food will cause the character will gain weight. This can be avoided by working out in a gym, which also has the effect of improving the character's strength and stamina.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players are also able to customize their cars. To modify a car, you merely have to take it to a garage that caters to such a type of car, and then select various modifications to be installed. These could include things such as the availability of <a href=\"..\/..\/nitrous\/93-503\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nitrous<\/a>, Hydraulics, as well as some minor cosmetic tweaks, such as the addition of rims and fenders.<\/p><h3>Stats<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/188808-sa_024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-188808\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/188808-sa_024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-188808\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/1927\/188808-sa_024.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The bicycle is one of the new vehicles in San Andreas.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In order to make customization of CJ and vehicle usage more valuable, you will slowly improve with different stats. If you use one weapon repeatedly, you will advance your skill level with it. Earning a higher skill level means that you can do more with the weapons you carry. The levels move from Beginner, to Gangster, and finally to Hitman. Generally, getting the Hitman level means that you are able to move while shooting. With the one-handed weapons, however, you can also dual wield them, as a bonus for reaching the Hitman level. Dual wielded weapons are much the same as the standard weapons, but with double the firepower. Some special weapons, such as the <a href=\"\/rpg-7\/3055-682\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-682\">RPG-7<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/flamethrower\/3055-45\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-45\">Flamethrower<\/a>, do not have skill levels, so you cannot advance your abilities with them. Driving cars for long periods of time will increase your driving skill, and this will make vehicles more useful. Higher driver skill levels mean that cars will handle more responsively, and you won\u2019t be fishtailing on a turn as often. Not only this, but a talented driver can also travel at higher speeds. CJ can also improve with his flight abilities, boating, and biking abilities too.<\/p><h3>Flying<\/h3><h3><span style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:25px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif;\">San Andreas also features a greater selection of aircraft than was seen in previous instalments. Players can increase their Flying Skill as they use aircraft to travel across the environment, with the effect that the different forms of aircraft become easier to handle and control.<\/span><\/h3><h3>Relationship<\/h3><p style=\"\">San Andreas added in a \u2018girlfriend\u2019 feature, which did not appear in any previous game in the series. This system was somewhat revamped for its second appearance, in 2008\u2019s Grand Theft Auto IV. As you played through the game, you would occasionally meet a character who did not look like any other NPC. Chatting to them, and fulfilling certain criteria meant that you could take them on a date. The different girlfriends all have different criteria; for example: the police officer in the desert town likes overweight men. Once you had found a character to act as a girlfriend, you simply arrive at their home, and take them to where they request. Characters may want to eat, or go out dancing. One of the girlfriends has a request where you simply have to let her kill someone. Once you have completed the criteria, you return the character home, and your relationship with them will increase. Once you reach different milestones you will get different gifts from your chosen girlfriend. For example, getting to 50% will allow you to take their car, and getting to 100% will earn you a piece of exclusive clothing. Once you reach a milestone you will be invited into their house for some \u2018coffee\u2019 (see: \u201cHot Coffee\u201d at the bottom of the page for more information).<\/p><h3>Gangs<\/h3><p style=\"\">CJ is a member of the Grove Street Families, one of the various gangs featured in the game. CJ has the ability to recruit fellow gang members who then will follow him to support attacks on enemy gangs. CJ can also instigate gang wars, either by himself or with others, by going to an enemy gang territory and killing three gang members. After doing so, three waves of gangs will spawn one after the other. If CJ defeats all of them, the territory will go under the control of the Grove Street Families. The more territories that are under their control, the more money that is generated. It is possible to hold all the territory in Los Santos, resulting in Grove Street being the only gang present. This requires capturing some territories that only hold one side of a street block.<\/p><h3>Cheat codes<\/h3><p style=\"\">Both <a href=\"\/grand-theft-auto-iii\/3030-3724\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\"><i>Grand Theft Auto III<\/i><\/a> and <i>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City<\/i> had a wide host of cheat codes available, and <i>San Andreas<\/i> is no different. There are somewhat normal cheats that grant players full health, armor, weapons, vehicles, and money, as well as some cheats that change world properties such as massive bicycle bunny-hops, flying cars, homicidal citizens, and super punching. CJ's RPG elements can also be modified through cheat codes. There are nearly 90 cheat codes in total.<\/p><h2><b>Story<\/b><\/h2><h3><b>Los Santos<\/b><\/h3><p style=\"\">The story of San Andreas follows one Carl \u2018CJ\u2019 Johnson, who has returned to the state after the death of his mother. Carl is, or rather, was, a member of the \u2018Grove Street Families\u2019, which were a powerful gang in the past. Carl was a founding member of the gang, and he left them when his brother Brian died, five years before the events of the game.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/10047-vinewood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10047\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/10047-vinewood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10047\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/4\/10047-vinewood.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Vinewood, Los Santos. Notice the inspiration?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game opens up with Carl at the <a href=\"..\/..\/francis-international-airport\/95-1139\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Francis International Airport<\/a> in <a href=\"\/liberty-city\/3035-15\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-15\">Liberty City<\/a>. He passes his luggage through the scanner, and proceeds to the plane. The game then cuts to his arrival in San Andreas. A police car pulls the taxi Carl is traveling in over, and the officers inside drag Carl out of the vehicle. Their plan is to frame Carl for homicide, after they shot dead fellow officer Ralph Pendelbury. Not only this, but to add insult to injury, they drop Carl off in the neighborhood of the Grove Street Families\u2019 archrivals, the Ballas. The first main mission is mainly getting to grips with the game, and learning the controls of the BMX bike, which was a new feature added to the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once CJ arrives home, he discovers the Grove Street Families are almost eradicated. The threat posed by the Ballas has shot up, and Grove Street is barely holding on. As Carl enters the family house, he is confronted by Big Smoke, a fellow gang member, who is wielding a Baseball Bat. Carl explains who he is, as Smoke seems to have forgotten him, and the two greet each other before Smoke invites Carl to travel to the funeral of his mother with him. Once the two men arrive, they are ambushed by the Ballas, who arrive in a <a href=\"\/voodoo\/3055-1549\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1549\">Voodoo<\/a> car, and start shooting. To survive, your group run to <a href=\"..\/..\/bmx\/93-2577\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BMXs<\/a>, and you are asked to escape the Voodoo and return to the Grove neighborhood. Once you return you will learn more about the gang and the members.

Initially, he treats Carl with hostility after he \u2018ran away\u2019 five years ago. Early in the game he frequently asks CJ, \u201cWhen are you going to run away again?\u201d. Ryder and Smoke act as the gang lieutenants, and Smoke is the only member of the gang who seems accepting of Carl again. One of the key elements of the Grove Street Families is that they are strongly anti-drug dealing. The Ballas, however, are not, and make much of their profits peddling dope.<\/p><p style=\"\">As you progress you will discover that <a href=\"..\/..\/kendl-johnson\/94-4450\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kendl<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/sean-johnson\/94-771\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sweet<\/a> and Carl\u2019s sister, is going out with a Mexican guy called Cesar Vialpando. Carl seems accepting of this fact, whereas Sweet says several stereotypical things about Cesar. However, Cesar introduces Carl to multiple different practices ongoing in San Andreas, such as illegal street races and lowrider meets. Cesar is a big fan of cars, and many of his missions revolve around driving and stealing them. Once you progress through the game, you will begin to take over territories for the gang, and start weakening the Ballas.<\/p><p style=\"\">During missions, Ryder mentions a rumor that had been circulating. Apparently, a green <a href=\"..\/..\/sabre\/93-1530\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sabre<\/a> sports car was the vehicle used during the shooting of Carl\u2019s mother. Initially, this Sabre appears to be nothing more than a simple rumor. Sweet decides that it is time for the Grove gang to become the powerful alliance they were in the past, and they arrange a \u2018sit-down\u2019 between the leaders of the gangs that used to be the alliance. However, as this happens, the SWAT attack the motel the meet is ongoing in. Immediately, Ryder and Big Smoke speed off, explaining that it is \u201cEvery motherfucker for himself\u201d. However, Carl chooses to enter the motel and save his brother. You shoot your way through the motel, and eventually reach Sweet. The two escape the motel, while Ryder and Smoke arrive to pick them up again. This section of the game acts as an \u2018on-rails\u2019 shooter where you merely have to unload into the approaching police forces. After this mission, Sweet wants to take the fight to the Ballas, and completely annihilate the gang. Carl is asked to help with this attack, which he accepts. However, Cesar calls him and asks him to meet him first, before doing anything. When Carl arrives he gets into Cesar\u2019s car, and watches Ryder, Big Smoke, and the corrupt police officers walk out of a garage. Then the worrying thing happens: they open the door to the garage\u2026 which houses a green Sabre. Ryder and Smoke had a part in the death of Carl\u2019s mother. As CJ sets off to Sweet, he realizes that his brother is walking into an ambush. Frantically, he tries to call him to call off the attack, but he is too late to do anything. The attack goes ahead as planned under the Mulholland Intersection, and Sweet is trapped in an ambush. When Carl arrives, he fights off the Ballas, before a huge number of police arrive to arrest the survivors. However, before this happens, Sweet takes a bullet to the chest. Carl surrenders as he fears about losing another member of his family.<\/p><h3>Countryside and San Fierro<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once CJ surrenders, the game cuts to all black and voices. Carl has a bag over his head, and the corrupt officers from the start of the game, <a href=\"..\/..\/eddie-pulaski\/94-4305\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eddie Pulaski<\/a>, Hernandez, and <a href=\"..\/..\/frank-tenpenny\/94-954\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frank Tenpenny<\/a> have Carl in the back of their patrol car. CJ pleads for them to take the bag off his head as he cannot breathe, and inquires about Sweet. Tenpenny says that Sweet is in a prison hospital, being treated for a bull et wound. He also says that they are in \u2018The middle of fucking nowhere\u2019, and leaves Carl there. In actual fact, you are in a small country village called Whetstone, which is near the largest peak in the game: Mount Chiliad. Tenpenny gets in contact with Carl, and instructs him to kill a man who is hiding out on Mount Chiliad. This man has evidence against Tenpenny and Pulaski, and they need to remove him from existence. Permanently. Once the killing is completed, you are instructed to take a photo of the corpse to prove that the man is dead.<\/p><p style=\"\">Eventually, Cesar will get in contact with you again. He says the Los Santos gang scene has fallen into anarchy, and it\u2019s extremely dangerous to be in a gang in Los Santos. When he asks where you are, he directs you to a cousin of his who may be of use to you. This cousin of his is Catalina. Catalina is a psychotic woman, who is obsessed with committing criminal acts. When CJ meets her, she wastes no time in explaining her plan for criminal deeds across the countryside of San Andreas. These missions basically involve different acts of theft, and then escaping the police. Catalina has frequent mood swings, as occasionally she is pleasant, before becoming extremely angry, extremely quickly. Not only do you meet Catalina, you meet a hippie by the name of \u2018 <a href=\"..\/..\/the-truth\/94-4578\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Truth<\/a>\u2019. This guy asks you to steal a <a href=\"..\/..\/combine-harvester\/93-2056\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Combine Harvester<\/a>, so he may harvest drugs he is growing out in the countryside. He refers to his drugs as \u2018whoop-de-doo\u2019, and tells Carl he will be in contact with him again in the future.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30036\/898310-wuzimuart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-898310\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30036\/898310-wuzimuart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-898310\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/3\/30036\/898310-wuzimuart.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Woozie's artwork<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Again, Cesar contacts you and asks you to meet him in the middle of the countryside so they can observe a meeting between Ryder and other key targets. These targets are known as \u2018The Syndicate\u2019, and will be integral to the game story. One by one the targets arrive, before you must take a picture of all of them individually. This is a reasonably straightforward activity, and is not extremely challenging. Before you go anywhere from here on, you must take part in two races. These races are both off road, and the second is merely the same course in reverse. The first run qualifies the winner to take part in the second race. In the second race, there is a driver by the name of \u2018 <a href=\"..\/..\/wu-zi-mu\/94-3904\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wu Zi Mu<\/a>\u2019, but he is known as Woozie. Woozie is extremely gracious in defeat, and calmly hands over the keys to the car he was driving: a black <a href=\"..\/..\/zr-350\/93-1663\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZR-350<\/a>. Not only does Woozie compete in this race, so does Catalina\u2019s new boyfriend. This boyfriend happens to be <a href=\"..\/..\/claude-speed\/94-322\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claude Speed<\/a>, from Grand Theft Auto III. <a href=\"..\/..\/catalina\/94-4446\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catalina<\/a> hands over the deed to a garage in an industrial area of San Fierro, but refuses to hand over the keys to the car Claude was driving, as they \u2018need it to go to Liberty City\u2019. As soon as this race is completed, Carl receives a call from The Truth. The \u2018whoop-de-doo\u2019 is ready.<\/p><p style=\"\">When Carl arrives at The Truth\u2019s farm, he sees the quantity of drugs that The Truth has been growing. Some of the drugs had already been loaded into Truth\u2019s van, but the police raid the farm with a helicopter before they could all successfully be loaded. The Truth tosses you a <a href=\"\/flamethrower\/3055-45\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-45\">flamethrower<\/a> and instructs you to incinerate everything, rather than allowing the police to confiscate evidence against him. Once the helicopter hovers overhead, The Truth then hands you an <a href=\"..\/..\/rpg-7\/93-682\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">RPG-7<\/a> rocket launcher and orders you to shoot it down. He then drives a small distance ahead to avoid the explosion. However, he stops to allow you to get in. The Truth refuses to drive, because apparently he has not driven in 20 years, and his van engine is surviving on 15 year old cooking oil. Not only this, his van is weighted down with half a ton of drugs (however, it actually is able to reach the same speed as other models). You are tasked with driving the van to the garage that you won from Catalina a few missions earlier.<\/p><h3>San Fierro<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once the van arrives at the garage, which is in the industrial area of Doherty, you discover that Catalina has played you. The place is a mess, and is completely worthless. Cesar, and Carl\u2019s sister Kendl both arrive at the garage as well. The only member of the group who sees the potential that the garage has, is Kendl. She sees the building as an opportunity to live a normal life with a legitimate business away from criminal activities. However, Carl and Cesar see the same option: an illegal chop shop. The Truth says he can possibly get some of his connections to be a help to the business. He has a lot of connections, and these men he knows are ideal for working with vehicles. CJ and The Truth set off in an Emperor car to find them at their current places of employment. One works at a gas station, and the other works at a hot dog van. Both of them are more than willing to get a different employment. However, the other man is Zero, a genius with electronics and computers. Zero is responsible for many of the gadgets you\u2019ll use in missions, and he\u2019s also interested in the chop shop idea. Once the chop shop is up and running, Tenpenny will be requesting you deal with a man. The man in question happens to be the DA (District Attorney), and he wants to frame him. To do this, you need to kill one of the valets at a hotel and steal his uniform. When the valet enters you need to take his car to your chop shop where it is to be loaded with drugs and then returned.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9825\/846914-gallery34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846914\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9825\/846914-gallery34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-846914\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/9825\/846914-gallery34.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Pizza Shop in San Andreas... before the inevitable massacre<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After a while, you will receive the opportunity to visit Woozie. One of Woozie\u2019s guys tells you that Woozie is actually blind, yet has incredible fortune. Apparently they call Woozie their \u2018Lucky Mole\u2019. Woozie wants to meet with another Triad group and see what is the cause of the goings-on in their neighborhood. However, when you arrive with Woozie you find the other Triad group massacred, and are ambushed. You find one of the other Triad members hiding in a garage because of the shooting, and Woozie takes pity on him and allows him to flee without punishment. The assailants who ambush Carl and Woozie are part of a newer Vietnamese gang, called the \u2018Da Nang Boys\u2019. Carl and Woozie escape in a stolen Da Nang Sentinel car, and kill the would-be assassins. After this, Woozie invites the leader of another Triad group to his location. This leader is \u2018Ran Fa Li\u2019, and the Da Nang Boys are planning to assassinate him as he leaves the building. Carl offers his services, and drives a decoy car into the countryside as a lure. The Da Nang assassins take the bait and Ran Fa Li escapes the assassination.<\/p><p style=\"\">After some time, Woozie arrives at the garage, where he uses his knowledge to give information on the different syndicate members. Unfortunately, Woozie only knows two of the three people. However, they are <a href=\"..\/..\/t-bone-mendez\/94-5065\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T-Bone Mendez<\/a>, leader of the San Fierro Rifa, and <a href=\"..\/..\/jizzy-b\/94-5070\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jizzy B<\/a>, the pimp who owns the Pleasure Domes. Mendez acts as an enforcer for Jizzy, and Carl decides to try and earn their trust. Initially, Jizzy gives Carl a list of objectives to complete. These objectives are merely to save his \u2018hos\u2019, as he calls them, from clients. Once the final client is killed, the police wanted level shoots up to three stars, and Jizzy tells you to keep the car, dump it, whatever \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want a hot car back. After this, Jizzy sends you out with T-Bone to track down a member of the Syndicate, who was in a drug van, that had been hijacked. However, the only idea where the van is, is from the member of the, Syndicate who happens to have been forced into the back of the van, and is calling you through his cell phone. However, his phone has only a few minutes of battery left, and you have to find him quickly. Once you find him, a shootout ensues, and you must destroy the van. It\u2019s better to have a setback in the loss of the drugs, than a full stop in the form of being arrested. Once the van is destroyed, all you have to do is escape to the Pleasure Domes and the mission is completed. Jizzy begins to trust Carl after this incident, and eventually, you are told to kill him. To do this, you break into the Pleasure Domes and work your way through the building. Jizzy escapes to his car, and you have to chase him down and destroy the car to kill him.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13313\/709166-majestic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-709166\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13313\/709166-majestic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-709166\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/13313\/709166-majestic.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Bangin'.. because even gangstas drive the sorts of things.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Not only this, but Woozie is also interested in your services. The Da Nang boys are becoming more of a threat, and they try to stop you picking up a drug car for Woozie from the San Fierro airport. Once the vehicle is delivered, one of Woozie\u2019s missions will begin with him asking if you are good underwater. He wants you to sneak onto a boat used by the Da Nang Boys, that happens to be in the harbor and plant a bug in it. However, after this, the next mission involves you strafing over the boat, killing Da Nang members with the mounted minigun. Woozie mentions in passing before this, that he is starting a new business venture that he wants you to be part of. He says he will call you when everything is finalized, and ready for business. However, as the helicopter performs strafing runs of the boat, one of the Da Nang Boys will strike the chopper with an RPG-7, causing it to plunge into the water. Everyone on board, except Carl is killed by this. However, you do take a casualty in the form of the loss of weapons. Once you have executed the Da Nang Boys leader, the mission is a success.<\/p><p style=\"\">Before you may leave for Las Venturas, Cesar calls. He says he\u2019s overlooking a meeting by members of the syndicate you\u2019ve been tracking for some time. Among the men present, are Ryder, and T-Bone. Woozie volunteers the services of some of his men in the attack, where Carl plans to kill Ryder and T-Bone. To begin with, the Triad are cut down, and the only option you have is to go in guns blazing. Ryder will attempt to flee and steal a boat, where if you\u2019re quick, you can snipe him immediately. Additionally, more information has appeared about the third man: <a href=\"..\/..\/mike-toreno\/94-4565\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Toreno<\/a>. After shooting down Toreno\u2019s helicopter, you assume he is dead, before heading to Las Venturas and the desert surrounding it.<\/p><h3>Desert and Las Venturas<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3584\/194201-las_venturas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194201\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3584\/194201-las_venturas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194201\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/3584\/194201-las_venturas.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Las Venturas Nightlife<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Before too long, you are contacted by an unknown caller who happens to know about Sweet and his impending sentence. He invites you to visit him at his ranch in the deserts. However, to prove you are worthy he makes you race in a Monster Truck around the landscapes, and show your dedication. After this, he introduces himself as Mike Toreno\u2026. the government agent. Toreno was working to take down the Syndicate as well, and that is why he ordered the destruction of the van back in San Fierro. It wasn\u2019t to avoid being set back\u2026 it was to be a setback. Toreno has a lot of influence in the government, and he could have Sweet\u2019s record and sentence cleared altogether, should he have a reason to. And his reason for doing so, unfortunately, means that Carl will have to attempt to complete some near-suicidal objectives.<\/p><p style=\"\">Carl is ordered by Mike to steal a truck with a trailer full of goods. The goods themselves are never explained, but the truck needs to be hijacked as it travels down the freeway. Toreno recommends that Carl calls Cesar. However, he has already called Cesar for him, as he arrives just after the objective is explained. Cesar jumps to the truck, and then you need to commandeer it and take it to the defined location. After this, Carl is asked to do some other errands, such as shooting down a helicopter to cover some government agents as they parachute in. Initially, Toreno is quite hostile towards Carl, and sees him as nothing more than an expendable asset, but by the end of his final request, the two are reasonably friendly. One of the things Toreno needs you to do, is to learn how to fly a plane. He needs you to fly a plane to do some \u2019things\u2019 for him. This means purchasing the Verdant Meadows airstrip in the desert for $80,000. Toreno requests that you deliver some goods to a location in San Fierro\u2019s countryside, and then return. You need to do this without appearing on radar, or there will be fighter jets chasing after you, making the mission impossible. At the end of these missions, there is a huge plane sitting on the airstrip, and guys in suits are loading it. According to Mike, these men are a splinter cell from the governmental agents and they need to be stopped. To do this, you need to use a bike and speed into the plane as it prepares to take off. Once this is done, the plane needs to be destroyed in midair.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/10052-sanfierro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10052\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4\/10052-sanfierro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10052\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/4\/10052-sanfierro.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Fierro's Gant Bridge, linking it with Venturas<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Once this is done, The Truth has some uses for your airstrip as well, and he wants you to sneak into a restricted governmental area and steal a prototype for him. This means infiltrating the base at night, and sneaking through it to steal the object, known as the \u2018Black Project\u2019. The Black Project turns out to be a <a href=\"..\/..\/jet-pack\/93-6\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jetpack<\/a> that you can fly with. This pack means a lot to The Truth, as it allows him to find something he wants. Once you have the Jetpack he tells you to fly to a train travelling across the desert and steal, \u2018Whatever it is they least want you to get\u2019. This means killing everyone on board the train and then stealing a jar of green \u2018goo\u2019. According to The Truth, this goo proves the existence of aliens, as this is their DNA.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once you have helped these two people, Woozie will call to let you know that his business venture is back up and running. It happens to be an Asian-themed casino along the Venturas Strip. The casino is called the Four Dragons, and he wants to offer you a partnership in the business. The meeting is disturbed however, by the announcement that someone was caught trying to vandalize the machines. Woozie says it\u2019s madness, as he\u2019s trying to open a <a href=\"..\/..\/triad\/92-2880\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triad<\/a> casino in a <a href=\"..\/..\/the-mafia\/92-1294\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mafia<\/a> town. However, Carl decides to be creative with torturing the thug. Carl asks one of the Triad members to tie the man to the front of a car, before driving dangerously to try and squeeze information out of him. Eventually the guy on the hood of the car cracks and says he\u2019s part of the <a href=\"..\/..\/johnny-sindacco\/94-9674\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sindacco<\/a> family. This is all the information required.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4936\/525657-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_11_14_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-525657\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4936\/525657-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_11_14_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-525657\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/4936\/525657-gta_sa_2008_01_03_17_11_14_04.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>EL CAMINO. EL EL CAMIIIINO.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Sindaccos are in a shared business with at least one other crime family, and that happens to be the Caligula\u2019s Casino, which is also located along the strip. Woozie and Carl decide to build a plan to ransack Caligula\u2019s, and make the Three Dragons the bigger of the two casinos. To do this Carl builds the trust of the men at Caligula\u2019s, by working for them. One of the biggest requests is that Carl flies back to <a href=\"..\/..\/liberty-city\/95-15\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liberty City<\/a>, and kills a man for <a href=\"..\/..\/salvatore-leone\/94-1191\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Salvatore Leone<\/a>. This mission involves stealing a plane, and then flying to a point where the game loads the part of the city required (St. Mark\u2019s Bistro), and then you get the opportunity to kill the target. Once this is done, you return to San Andreas, and report the success to Salvatore. After this, the other Mafia are enraged and send a hit squad to <a href=\"..\/..\/san-andreas\/95-17\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">San Andreas<\/a> to assassinate Salvatore Leone. However, he is prepared for this, and commands Carl to kill the assassins mid-flight. To do this, you steal a <a href=\"..\/..\/dodo\/93-1499\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dodo<\/a> plane at the <a href=\"..\/..\/las-venturas-airport\/95-1158\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Las Venturas airport<\/a>, and leap to the hostile plane, which is a <a href=\"..\/..\/shamal\/93-2584\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shamal<\/a>. Once you are in the plane you merely need to kill the men traveling aboard it, and return to complete the job.<\/p><p style=\"\">After some time you will find a mission where the rapper, <a href=\"..\/..\/madd-dogg\/94-1320\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madd Dogg<\/a>, is planning to jump from the roof of a casino due to the actions you undertook back in <a href=\"..\/..\/los-santos\/95-19\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Los Santos<\/a> for <a href=\"..\/..\/og-loc\/94-2692\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OG Loc<\/a>. A crowd of gamblers have gathered to encourage him to jump, and Carl wants to avoid it happening. He steals a <a href=\"..\/..\/walton\/93-1632\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walton<\/a> truck and angles it to break Madd Dogg\u2019s fall. After this, you drive him to the hospital. He asks for you to be his manager in the future.<\/p><p style=\"\">Before leaving and returning to San Andreas you will meet with Tenpenny and his \u2018Polish lapdog\u2019, Eddie Pulaski. They take you out to a desert town and instruct you to dig your own grave. Suddenly, Hernandez runs in, before hitting Pulaski around the head with a spade and announcing he\u2019s with the DEA. Pulaski then kills Hernandez as well, before running to his car, which is a white <a href=\"..\/..\/buffalo\/93-2625\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buffalo<\/a>. The only vehicle apart from it that is sitting nearby happens to be a <a href=\"..\/..\/bandito\/93-2606\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bandito<\/a>, so it is your only option for pursuit. As you chase Pulaski, he shouts obscenities and taunts you. One of the most vicious of these is that the police touched his mother\u2019s corpse, and this angers Carl in a major way. Once the Buffalo is badly damaged, Pulaski gets out. He is armed with a <a href=\"..\/..\/desert-eagle\/93-90\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Desert Eagle<\/a>, so he can cause severe damage. Carl asks Pulaski if he has any last words as he lies against his car, dying. The final thing Eddie Pulaski said to Carl was \u201cCan I fuck your sister?\u201d<\/p><h3>Los Santos (return)<\/h3><p style=\"\">After completing all the requested missions, you will return to Los Santos. Initially, you parachute over Madd Dogg\u2019s mansion as it has been taken over by a drug lord. The mansion will become the new base of operations for the group, once it is reclaimed. To reclaim it you simply have to kill your way through before killing the drug lord in possession of it. Initially you jump with a group of Triads, who can help you during the mission. However, at least one of them will die due to the scripted cutscene. Madd Dogg needs his mansion back, as he wants to kick-start his career again, and what better way than to take back his mansion?<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/245219-311_gtasa_grove.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245219\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/245219-311_gtasa_grove.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245219\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/1927\/245219-311_gtasa_grove.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Carl, Ryder, and Sweet sitting beside a car<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The next mission begins with Madd Dogg rapping, and then his sound booth being hijacked by Mike Toreno, who instructs Carl to leave the building and meet him outside. Toreno wants Carl to infiltrate a governmental aircraft carrier, and steal a <a href=\"..\/..\/hydra\/93-2593\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydra<\/a> fighter jet from the boat. This jet will be needed to destroy some ships that are being used for spying by enemies of the state, apparently. After the jet takes off you will be pursued by two AI enemies, who pose little threat if you use lock-on with the heat seeking missiles on them. After destroying the boats, you are told to land the Hydra at Verdant Meadows. After this, Carl screams at Mike that he is never doing anything for him again. However, the Hydra will now spawn at this airstrip for the player to use.<\/p><p style=\"\">After completing this mission, and starting the next one at Madd Dogg\u2019s mansion, Toreno will personally enter the building and ask Carl to do one last favor for him. CJ pulls out a pistol and threatens him, but Mike says that the mission is to pick Sweet up. Toreno fulfilled his promise, albeit after requesting some suicidal tasks. Once Sweet has been picked up, he wants to be taken home to the Grove area. He does not approve of Carl\u2019s wealthy new lifestyle, and makes his feelings known. Carl feels that there is more to life than the Grove Street Families, and Sweet disagrees, saying that he was born in the Grove and he would more than likely die in the Grove too.<\/p><p style=\"\">The final mission involving Madd Dogg\u2019s mansion involves Madd Dogg himself.

OG Loc flees on a hovercraft after this, before switching to a Go Kart when he reaches the Santa Maria Beach in Los Santos. Eventually, he is cornered, and surrenders the work of Madd Dogg to him.<\/p><p style=\"\">During the time Carl has been away from the Grove, and Sweet has not been there to maintain it, the entire area has become territory of the Ballas. Sweet feels it is time to make the presence of the families known, and wants to push the Ballas out of their territory. Some of the Grove gang members have also dropped their flags, and are now working for the Ballas as drug suppliers and dealers. One of these men is B-Dup, who is now living in Glen Park, in the heart of Ballas territory. When Sweet and CJ pay him a visit he orders his drug fiend friend, Bear, to take care of them. However, Bear turns around and punches B-Dup, flooring him. Bear says he is \u2018tired of the drugs, and tired of making your [B-Dup\u2019s] goddamned toilet sparkle\u2019. Bear and Sweet drive off in a car stolen from B-Dup, and Sweet says he\u2019s going to help Bear get over his addiction.<\/p><p style=\"\">After this, it shows the trial of Officer Frank Tenpenny. Tenpenny is being convicted for masterminding a major crime syndicate, and killing fellow officer Ralph Pendlebury. However, in an incredibly corrupt turn of events, Frank is let off without any charges being pressed, due to an apparent lack of evidence. This shock ruling drives the citizens of Los Santos into a frenzy, and starts a riot. During this riot, Cesar requests Carl\u2019s assistance in using the events to his advantage. His plan is for his gang to push the Vagos out of their hood, and this means killing every one of them, during the anarchy ongoing. Not only this, but Sweet wants to find Smoke and kill him too.<\/p><h3>Finale<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/245293-1903_gtasa_big_smoke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245293\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/245293-1903_gtasa_big_smoke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245293\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/1927\/245293-1903_gtasa_big_smoke.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Smoke's artwork<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The finale of the game involves an assault on Big Smoke\u2019s crack palace in Los Flores. Sweet and Carl arrive at the building to discover it is well protected, and it will be difficult to enter the building\u2026 unless, of course, a large enough vehicle ran into the walls. Conv eniently, there is a SWAT tank sitting down the road, fending off rioters along with the SWAT teams. Carl steals the tank, and drives it into the front of the building. After this, you must fight through the building solo, as Sweet wants to keep an eye on what is ongoing on the streets. There are multiple different floors to the building, and you need to reach the top one to find Smoke. Once you fight your way to the top floor you will see Big Smoke playing on a games console, almost trying to ignore what was going to happen. Carl confronts Smoke, and Smoke runs away wielding an <a href=\"..\/..\/ak-47\/93-187\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AK-47<\/a>. After taking some damage, Big Smoke will turn the lights off in the room, but he leaves a pair of Nightvision Goggles sitting in the room, which you can steal to make the fight much, much easier. After succeeding to kill Smoke, he lies against a wall bleeding. Carl asks Smoke why he did it, and Big Smoke says he wanted people to remember his name, before he dies.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/245187-1904_gtasa_officer_tenpenny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245187\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1927\/245187-1904_gtasa_officer_tenpenny.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245187\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/1927\/245187-1904_gtasa_officer_tenpenny.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Tenpenny's artwork<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After Smoke dies, Carl turns around and prepares to leave. However he is confronted by Frank Tenpenny, who is pointing a <a href=\"..\/..\/spas-12\/93-1364\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SPAS-12<\/a> (Combat Shotgun in-game) at him. Tenpenny orders Carl to open the safe beside Smoke\u2019s television and put the money into the bag that he hands him. Frank is preparing to flee the state, before the public find him and turn against him. Once Frank has the money, he sets the building ablaze before running. Carl has to fight his way out of the burning building as well as try to extinguish some of the flames. Once you escape the building, you will see Tenpenny climbing into a fire truck, before Sweet sprints along his car\u2019s roof and leaps onto the ladder. Carl has to give chase \u2013 not only to kill Tenpenny but to prevent his brother dying. After some time, an officer tries to loosen Sweet\u2019s grip on the ladder. However, you get the car under the ladder so Sweet lands safely in the car. He takes control, and this plays as another \u2018on-rails\u2019 shooting scene. Tenpenny\u2019s engine cannot be destroyed so you merely have to focus on killing the enemies pursuing. Tenpenny tries to make it over the bridge at the Grove Street area, but he loses control, before crashing off the bridge into the Grove, where he dies. After this, there is a cutscene where Madd Dogg announces his success, and the Gold Record award that the group has earned from getting his rhymes back.<\/p><h2>Side Missions<\/h2><p style=\"\">Considering the sheer size of San Andreas, additional side missions were to be expected. While these side missions are not essential to completing the game, they are important for getting the 100% completion statistic. Below are the side missions contained in the game:<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Dealership<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Once you complete the Driving School in San Fierro, you will receive a phone call to let you know that the dealership opposite the garage is for sale. The dealership happens to be called \u2018Wang Cars\u2019, and is on sale for a mere $50,000. Once you purchase the dealership, you will get some missions. Generally, these missions ask you to steal certain cars. Completing the mission will make the car you collected appear in the dealership. There are five missions for the Dealership strand, and they will earn you the following cars for your dealership:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/uranus\/93-1546\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Uranus<\/b><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/sultan\/93-1573\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Sultan<\/b><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/stratum\/93-1584\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Stratum<\/b><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/savanna\/93-2642\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Savanna<\/b><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/elegy\/93-2638\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Elegy<\/b><\/a><\/li><\/ul><h3>Import and Export<\/h3><p style=\"\">After completing the Dealership side mission strand, you will be able to access a chalkboard at the docks. This board lists some cars that you are required to steal, and then return to the ship at the pier. There are several different lists that you must complete to finish this activity. You are paid for each car you return to the ship, but the price varies depending on what condition the car happens to be in. If the car is not damaged in any way you will earn the top price. When you enter a car required for this activity, a popup window will alert you to this fact. Once you have the car, you need to drive it onto the pier, before using the crane to move it onto the deck of the ship. After a car is delivered, you can use the board to purchase a car of the same model for yourself. This is a good way to acquire rarer cars, after delivering one to the ship. Once you have completed a list you will earn a large cash bonus, and there will be two different vehicles you can buy after this. These include special vehicles, such as the <a href=\"..\/..\/monster-truck\/93-1959\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monster Truck<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Taxi<\/h3><p style=\"\">If you enter a Taxi or <a href=\"..\/..\/cabbie\/93-1494\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cabbie<\/a>, you will have an option to engage in taxiing missions. These missions feel similar to the gameplay of <a href=\"..\/..\/crazy-taxi\/62-118\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crazy Taxi<\/a>. You need to find a fare, and then drive them to their desired destination within a time limit. Not only this, but there is a \u2018tip meter\u2019 that depletes depending on if you crash, and how long it takes you to arrive. You can still complete a fare with a fully depleted tip meter, but you will not earn much money. Not only this, but people will refuse to enter a badly damaged taxi, so driving neatly is very well rewarded. You earn extra money for completing multiple fares in a row. These rewards come in increments of five fares (5 in a row, 10 in a row, 15, etc.), and will give a considerable cash injection. You must complete 50 fares in total to \u2018complete\u2019 this activity. After doing so, all the Cabbies and Taxis in the game will spawn with nitrous and hydraulics.<\/p><h3>Vigilante<\/h3><p style=\"\">If you enter a police vehicle, such as the <a href=\"..\/..\/police-car\/93-844\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Police Car<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/rhino\/93-1647\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rhino tank<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/hpv-1000\/93-2594\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HPV-1000<\/a>, or <a href=\"..\/..\/fbi-rancher\/93-1645\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FBI Rancher<\/a>, you will be prompted to start the Vigilante side mission strand. These missions revolve around chasing down and killing criminals. What makes this mission strand difficult is that you can still earn a <a href=\"..\/..\/notoriety-system\/92-2973\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanted Level<\/a>, and the criminals are always armed. Generally, the easiest way to complete these missions is through using the Rhino tank, due to its power and strength.<\/p><h3>Ambulance<\/h3><p style=\"\">If you enter an Ambulance, you will be prompted to begin the Medical side mission strand. The aim is to pick up wounded civilians and drive them to a hospital. It plays similarly to the Taxi missions, but crashing can potentially kill a patient who is in the vehicle. What can make this somewhat easier is by using the siren to clear the roads, allowing you the right of way.<\/p><h3>Valet<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once you finish the mission \u2018777 We Tip\u2019, you will earn a Valet uniform in your Wardrobe. This uniform needs to be worn to complete this side mission. To play this mission you have to travel to the hotel in San Fierro where the mission took place. Civilians will drive over, and leave their cars to be valet parked. You must take the car, and then park it in the underground lot at the hotel. You must park a specified number of cars before moving onto the next level. You earn more money for parking a car well, and for not damaging a vehicle. You are punished for killing the other valets, however. After completing the six levels of this mode, you will begin earning money from the hotel.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p style=\"\">Weapons in San Andreas are purchased in an <a href=\"..\/..\/ammu-nation\/95-498\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ammu-Nation<\/a> gun store. There are several of these in each area of the city, and they all stock the same weaponry. Below is a breakdown of all the weapons you\u2019ll encounter in the state of San Andreas:<\/p><h3>Melee Weapons<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/brass-knuckles\/93-1157\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Brass Knuckles<\/b><\/a>: Found under the bridge in the Grove Street.

Generally the first hit floors a target, while the second hit will make sure they never get up again.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/chainsaw\/93-168\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Chainsaw<\/b><\/a>: Found on the Doherty construction site, amongst other places. One hit kill to enemies, and arguably one of the best melee weapons in the game.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/katana\/93-690\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Katana<\/b><\/a>: Able to occasionally kill an enemy with one hit. The Katana occasionally can decapitate, killing instantly.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/nightstick\/93-942\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Nightstick<\/b><\/a>: Found on the corpses of the police.

It doesn\u2019t do much damage either, but it is cheap and common.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/uzi\/93-260\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Micro Uzi<\/b><\/a>: Similar to the Tec-9, albeit with a higher rate of fire and a bigger magazine. It is also used by different gang members.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/mp5\/93-289\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>SMG<\/b><\/a>: Fires quickly and does the highest damage of an SMG. Comparable to an assault rifle, and is based on an MP5. It\u2019s used by some gang members when in a gang war.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Assault Rifles<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/m4-carbine\/93-622\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>M4<\/b><\/a>: Used by the military.

Also, it needs loaded with each round and is reasonably cheap.<\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/sniper-rifle\/93-67\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Sniper Rifle<\/b><\/a>: Precise, albeit with a low rate of fire due to the bolt action mechanism.

If you can overlook the other picture, this is actually relevant<\/figcaption><\/figure> In June of 2005 \"Hot Coffee\" was released by Dutch modder Patrick Wildenborg. What this software patch did was to unblock a previously inaccessible section of the game which had been created by Rockstar but then abandoned before release of the game. The section of the game in question was part of the \"dating missions\" where CJ could start a relationship with up to 6 girlfriends. Once he had successfully dated a girl she may invite him into her house for \"coffee\" and from there the player gets an exterior view of the house, from which they could hear CJ and his girlfriend engaging in sexual intercourse. With the Hot Coffee mod installed this scene is replaced with a minigame in which the player controls CJ's actions during the sex scene. None of the 6 possible scenes contained any nudity (although nude textures were later added by third-parties) and the animations and textures were clearly unfinished.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/316\/529371-gta191.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-529371\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/316\/529371-gta191.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-529371\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/316\/529371-gta191.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Where are her arms?<\/figcaption><\/figure> Rockstar initially denied that such a minigame was created by them and claimed that it was the result of \"hackers\". However it was later shown that Hot Coffee could be unlocked in both the Xbox and PS2 versions of the games. Both Rockstar and the ESRB ratings board came under fire for allowing the game to be rated M with no mention of sexual content.<br \/>On July 20th 2005, the ESRB announced that the current version of San Andreas at that time would be re-rated AO while Rockstar stated that it would produce all future versions of the game with the offending scenes removed. Rockstar owners Take-Two is said to have lost an estimated $6.9 million as a result of the controversy.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>\"Myths\" surrounding the game<\/h2><p style=\"\">With the game's immense scale, it was only a matter of time before myths and rumors popped up about what was roaming in the state of San Andreas. From things like Bigfoot and <a href=\"..\/..\/ufo\/93-611\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UFO's<\/a>, to people like Leatherface appearing. Even the game's satirical cult the Epsilon Program, became a source of myths and legend. Most (But not all) of these myths have been debunked in the years since the game's release. There were confirmed ones though like a rusted wheelchair on a dock which was in reference to a then future release of <a href=\"..\/..\/manhunt-2\/61-21258\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manhunt 2<\/a>.

Considering the scale of the game, there have been some extremely large tasks and projects organized by different PC gamers. Some players have made extremely comprehensive mods, including completely different stories, and reworked cities. Many GTA modding sites frequently still have mods for San Andreas uploaded daily. Some of the most common mods for the game are different cars and weapons. Videos of San Andreas on PC frequently show licensed cars due to modders creating them for use in the game world. It may not always be possible to mod versions of the game. Only the disc-based copies of San Andreas can support modding, and even then, only Version 1.1 of the game can be modded on. However, due to the works of the community, newer versions can be downgraded with different programs and software. On top of this, some coders have built programs to automatically install mods for players who are unsure of swapping files in the game folder.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32849\/1561208-sa_mp_001.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1561208\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32849\/1561208-sa_mp_001.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1561208\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/3\/32849\/1561208-sa_mp_001.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Silvia S15 mod in San Andreas Multiplayer, albeit with one of the bugs that can be encountered.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">One of the most ambitious mods, and one of the mods most commonly used alongside San Andreas is SA:MP. This mod allows players to create multiplayer matches and play with friends. Many of the servers created have different rules, and RPG servers are fairly common. They aim to simulate life, allowing players to own houses, cars, and so on. 'Deathmatch' servers are also commonly encountered, as players enjoy killing each other. Some mods can cause instabilities with certain features. For example, some modded cars cannot be altered in the garages. Trying to modify these cars can cause the game to stop responding or crash.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p style=\"\">Like all the Grand Theft Auto games, there are several different in-game radio stations. There are many different stations in the game, but the music played by the stations remain the same. However, with Radio Los Santos, initially the radio is advertised on by Madd Dogg, but after completing missions to make OG Loc more popular, he will take over the show. Once the game is completed, Madd Dogg will return as the advertiser. Below are the names of all the stations in San Andreas, their logo, their genre of music, and their playlists.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>WCTR Talk Radio<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/21933\/787214-wctr_talk_radio.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-787214\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/21933\/787214-wctr_talk_radio.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-787214\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/2\/21933\/787214-wctr_talk_radio.png\"><\/a><\/figure><b>Genre:<\/b> Talk Show<br \/><b>Producer:<\/b> Lazlow<br \/><ul><li>The News - <b>Leanne Forget<\/b><\/li><li>The Tight End Zone - <b>Derrick Thakery<\/b><\/li><li>The Wild Traveller - <b>James Pedeaston<\/b><\/li><li>Entertaining America - <b>Billy Dexter<\/b><\/li><li>Gardening with Maurice - <b>Maurice<\/b><\/li><li>I Say, You Say - <b>Peyton and Mary Phillips<\/b><\/li><li>Lonely Hearts - <b>Christy MacIntyre \/ Fernando<\/b><\/li><li>Area 53 - <b>Marvin Trill<\/b><\/li><\/ul><br \/>Lazlow himself appears in one of these shows.

Released in November of 2004, <i>World of Warcraft<\/i> was very well received, winning several awards in its first year and becoming the best-selling PC game of 2005 and 2006. By October of 2008 WoW had surpassed <a href=\"http:\/\/us.blizzard.com\/en-us\/company\/press\/pressreleases.html?081028\" rel=\"nofollow\">11 million subscribers worldwide<\/a>. Since its release, there have been four expansions adding new content and challenges for players to the game: <a href=\"..\/..\/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade\/61-18603\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Burning Crusade<\/a> in January 2007, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king\/3030-20701\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20701\">Wrath of the Lich King<\/a> in November 2008, <a href=\"\/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm\/3030-27896\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27896\">Cataclysm<\/a> in December 2010, and <a href=\"\/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria\/3030-36734\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36734\">Mists of Pandaria<\/a> in September 2012. The fifth expansion, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor\/3030-44468\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44468\">Warlords of Draenor<\/a>, will be released in 2014.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Getting Started<\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>Realm Selection -<\/b> The first decision to be made by a player is their choice of realm (i.e. server). All realms contain the same geographical lands, but the population and economy on each realm are different. There are four different realm categories which are as follows:<\/p><ul><li>Player vs Player ( <a href=\"\/player-vs-player\/3015-346\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-346\">PvP<\/a>) - Realms that allow for open combat between players of opposing factions. Only a select few areas are designated as neutral zones where players are safe from attack.<\/li><li>Player vs Environment ( <a href=\"\/player-vs-environment\/3015-349\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-349\">PvE<\/a>) - Realms that allow players to focus on defeating monsters and questing. Open player combat on occurs in designated areas or with player consent.<\/li><li>Roleplay (RP) - PvE realms designated for players that prefer to play in-character, literally playing their role in a form of digital acting.<\/li><li>Roleplay-PvP (RP-PvP) - RP realms with the open cross-faction combat of PvP realms.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Each account allows players to create a maximum of fifty characters on their choice of realms, with ten character slots available per realm. While created characters are typically locked to a realm, <a href=\"\/microtransaction\/3015-199\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-199\">paid character transfers<\/a> are available for a fee with certain restrictions.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Character Creation -<\/b> When creating a new character, players must first choose whether they want their character to be a member of the <a href=\"\/alliance\/3015-460\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-460\">Alliance<\/a> or the <a href=\"\/horde\/3015-459\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-459\">Horde<\/a>. Characters can only group together within their own faction. Depending on expansion purchases, players are able to choose from between four and six races per faction with a number of unique racial traits. Players have a few options to customize their character's physical appearance including gender, face, hair style and color, skin tone, and accessories.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once race has been selected, and depending on the number of expansions purchased, players are able to choose from between six and nine of ten different classes. (Although there are a total of ten classes available, each race only has access to certain classes.) Each class plays with their own unique mechanics and can be customized to fulfill at least one of three main roles: <a href=\"\/damage-per-second\/3015-1097\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1097\">DPS<\/a> (damage dealer) which all classes can be, or <a href=\"\/healer\/3015-188\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-188\">healer<\/a> or <a href=\"\/tank\/3015-438\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-438\">tank<\/a>, roles essential to advanced group play.<\/p><h3>Character Advancement<\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>Gaining Levels -<\/b> In the primary form of character advancement, characters progress in level up to a maximum of 90 (depending on expansions purchased) through earning experience points. Experience points are gained primarily through completing <a href=\"\/\">quests<\/a> and killing enemies (mobs) and secondarily through <a href=\"\/\">professions<\/a> and PvP combat.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Questing -<\/b> Players are typically given quests by NPC's, objects in the environment and looted items. The presence of an available quest is indicated by a yellow <a href=\"\/\">exclamation mark<\/a>. Most quests fall into one or more of the following categories:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/\">Kill quest<\/a> - Asks players to kill one or more mobs<\/li><li><a href=\"\/\">Fetch quest<\/a> - Asks players to gather one or more items from mobs or the environment<\/li><li><a href=\"\/\">Escort quest<\/a> - Asks players to protect an NPC or object<\/li><li>Delivery quest - Asks players to deliver either an item or themselves to a distant NPC<\/li><li>Exploration quest - Asks players to visit a certain area<\/li><li>Vehicle quests - Asks players to use vehicle or use cannons or such to complete your task. (Since WoTLK)<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Completing quests typically rewards players with experience points and currency. Some quests also provide players with items, equipment, and increased reputation with a specific faction. Once a character has completed all the quests in a given area, they will oftentimes be assigned a delivery or exploration quest which will lead them to their next set of quests in a new area.<\/p><p style=\"\">Certain areas of the world also give players access to special daily quests, typically after all other quests have been completed. Up to twenty-five of these special quests, indicated by a blue exclamation mark, can be completed by a character each day. These quests allow players to continue gaining reputation with a faction after clearing that faction's area of standard quests or earn special forms of currency at a metered rate.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Phasing -<\/b> By stacking different versions of the same environment on top of one another, <a href=\"\/phasing\/3015-2211\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2211\">phasing<\/a> allows players to change the world around them without impacting the experience of other players. For example, an area full of monsters may eventually be cleared and populated by friendly NPCs as part of a series of quests. That area would exist in two phases, with players only being able to see and interact with other players within the same phase.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Travel -<\/b> As players advance in level, their quests will take them to larger and larger areas farther and farther away. To help facilitate their travel and reduce downtime, players have a number of modes of transportation available to them.<\/p><ul><li>Flight Masters - Indicated by the presence of a green exclamation mark over their head, these NPCs fly characters to any connected flight points previously discovered for a small fee.<\/li><li>Boats\/Zeppelins - Boats and Zeppelins allow players to travel from one continent to another, normally via major cities.<\/li><li>Portals - Be they static or temporary, portals instantly transport characters to another area, most commonly a major city.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/mounts\/3015-409\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-409\">Mounts<\/a> - Depending on character level and expansions purchased, characters have access to a number of rideable mounts. These range from a seahorse that is only useable underwater to flying dragons. Mounts vary in speed depending on a characters level. Mounted speed increases accordingly: 60% land speed bonus at level 20, 100% at level 40. Players can purchase flying mounts once they reach level 70 that can have a 150% or 280% peed increase depending. At level 80 310% flying speed increase becomes unlockable. Some mounts even have the capability to carry more than one player at a time, although generally only very rare or hard to possess mounts have this ability.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><b>Dungeons -<\/b> A variety of dungeons are available to players throughout their leveling career. Unlike the rest of the game world, each time a dungeon is entered a unique instance is created, accessible only by a single group of players. Players unable to form a five-man group on their own can use the automated dungeon finder system to be matched with other players not only from their server, but from other servers within the same battlegroup. Each dungeon has a minimum level required to enter. The dungeon finder system has a minimum level of 15 required to use the tool to find level-appropriate dungeons.<\/p><p style=\"\">These dungeons are populated with significantly stronger monsters and typically include three or more boss battles. When encountered at the appropriate level, these bosses are extremely powerful and require coordinated teamwork between the three class roles.

The specialization you choose will assign you different abilities at specific levels. On some class types, different specializations will be assigned different roles (Tank, Healing, or DPS, respectively), though pure DPS classes do exist. Every class has at least one DPS specialization. The abilities gained through Specializations are predetermined as of Mists of Pandaria<em>,<\/em> and are no longer tied to talents.<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Talents - <\/strong>As of Mists of Pandaria, players are assigned one talent point every fifteen levels, which can be spent on one of three abilities in that tier (level 15 points cannot be spent on level 30 talents, level 75 talents cannot be used on level 60 talents). Talents are now totally independent of specialization, and of each other (it is no longer necessary to put a point into a certain talent to acquire another one).<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Glyphs - <\/strong>Glyphs, added with <em>Wrath of the Lich King<\/em>, are created by players using the inscription profession. They are used to add specific effects to spells. There are two kinds, major and minor. Major glyphs tend to be significant changes to the way the abilities are used, whereas minor glyphs tend to be cosmetic, or convenience based, and more based on preference than min-maxing. One glyph slot of each type is unlocked at levels 20, 50, and 80.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Professions -<\/b> Professions are trade skills which cover the <a href=\"\/resource-gathering\/3015-975\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-975\">resource gathering<\/a> and <a href=\"\/crafting\/3015-934\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-934\">item creation<\/a> systems in World of Warcraft. Each character can learn up to two of the eleven primary professions along with any number of secondary professions. While certain primary professions work better with others, there are no restrictions on which two professions a character can learn and an unsatisfied player can abandon one profession for another at any time. Professions give players access to valuable materials and powerful items that can be traded or sold, in addition to a number of unique bonuses available only to the profession holder.<\/p><h3>Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>Spells and Skills<\/b> - Throughout their leveling career, characters learn a variety of spells and skills with which to aid allies and slay foes.

Before the release of Burning Crusade, the Shaman player class was unique for the Horde and the Paladin class was unique for the Alliance, but due to difficulties in balancing out PvE content, the developers decided to make the Shaman and Paladin available for both factions, making it a selectable class for the new races on the opposite sides.<\/p><h3>Druid<\/h3><p style=\"\">The Druid is the most versatile class in the game. With the ability to change form, the Druid can switch between healing, tanking, and DPS. It is also available to the least amount of character races. Of the ten playable races, only Night Elves, Tauren, Trolls, and Worgen may be druids. The druid's three talent tree specs are Balance (offensive spellcasting), Restoration (healing and defensive spellcasting), which relies a lot on HoT spells (Healing over Time), and Feral, melee combat using the Cat Form (DPS) and Bear Form (Tank). The Cat Form can easily be compared to the Rogue class, because it has abilities like Ambush (Ravage) and Stealth (Prowl); it also utilizes the same Energy System. Meanwhile, the Bear Form can easily compared to the Warrior class with abilities like Charge (Feral Charge), Rend (Lacerate) and Cleave (Swipe). The Bear Form uses the Rage System for energy management.<\/p><p style=\"\">Druids also possess the ability to change form for traveling purposes. Travel form turns the druid into a stag, increasing run speed by 40%. Aquatic form shifts the druid into a sea lion like creature that increases swim speed by 50% and allows the druid to breathe underwater. Flight form changes the druid into a flying animal (different animal based on race) that allows the druid to fly at speeds dependent on the druids flight training level.<\/p><ul><li><b>Role:<\/b> Tank, Healer, Ranged Magic Damage Dealer, Melee Damage Dealer<\/li><li><b>Available Races:<\/b><i>Alliance:<\/i> Night Elf, Worgen<br \/><i>Horde:<\/i> Tauren, Troll<\/li><li><b>Available Armor:<\/b> Cloth, Leather<\/li><li><b>Available Weapons:<\/b> Daggers, Fist Weapons, One-Handed Maces, Polearms, Staves, Two-Handed Maces<\/li><li><b>Talent trees:<\/b> Balance - Feral\/Guardian(Tank specific Tree) - Restoration<\/li><\/ul><h3>Hunter<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37487\/1171667-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171667\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37487\/1171667-hunter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171667\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37487\/1171667-hunter.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Night Elf Hunter<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Hunter class performs pulling, threat redirection, crowd control and DPS. Hunters have pets that that can play a variety of roles. They can also track, tame, and train animals and beasts found in the wild to fight alongside them in combat, although some creatures are not tamable. Hunters focus on range damage and use abilities such as Concussive Shot, Scatter Shot, and Frost trap to slow down, freeze in place, or temporarily confuse the enemy from advancing on the hunter and nulling the hunters damage. In a solo pve enviorment, the ideal hunter relies on his pet for keeping aggro of the enemy NPC.<\/p><ul><li><b>Role:<\/b> Ranged Physical Damage Dealer<\/li><li><b>Available Races:<\/b><i>Alliance:<\/i> Draenei, Dwarf, Human, Night Elf, Worgen<br \/><i>Horde:<\/i> Blood Elf, Goblin, Orc, Tauren, Troll, Forsaken<\/li><li><b>Available Armor:<\/b> Cloth, Leather, Mail<\/li><li><b>Available Weapons:<\/b> Bows, Crossbows, Fist Weapons, Guns, One-Handed Axes, One-Handed Swords, Polearms, Staves, Two-Handed Axes, Two-Handed Swords<\/li><li><b>Talent trees:<\/b> Beast Mastery - Marksmanship - Survival<\/li><\/ul><h3>Mage<\/h3><p style=\"\">Mages are casters that specialize in burst damage and area of effect spells.

Paladins have been hit hardest by the scourge as it ravaged many of their numbers during the fall of Lodaeron and saw with it the disbanding of the Knights of the Silver Hand, their most prominent organization. As such, they have developed unique abilities when confronted with the unnatural undead entities of the Lich King and his scourge. Paladins are among the few of the classes with the flexibility to play a variety of different roles including DPS (Retribution), Tanking (Protection), and Healing (Holy). They can cast unique blessings that provide useful buffs for other players while withstanding heavy amounts of physical damage with plate armor and strong defensive capabilities. When Holy Speced, Paladins are the only plate wearing healing class in the game.<\/p><ul><li><b>Role:<\/b> Tank, Healer, Melee Damage Dealer<\/li><li><b>Available Races:<\/b><i>Alliance:<\/i> Draenei, Dwarf, Human<br \/><i>Horde:<\/i> Blood Elf, Tauren<\/li><li><b>Available Armor:<\/b> Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate<\/li><li><b>Available Weapons:<\/b> One-Handed Axes, One-Handed Maces, One-Handed Swords, Polearms, Two-Handed Axes, Two-Handed Maces, Two-Handed Swords, Relics, Shields<\/li><li><b>Talent trees:<\/b> Holy - Protection - Retribution<\/li><\/ul><h3>Priest<\/h3><p style=\"\">Priests are the primary healer classes of the game but also specialize in support healing and damage. The Holy spec is based around powerful single target and group healing. The Discipline spec is another healing spec but is more built around single target healing, damage prevention and utility. The Shadow spec is the damage dealing spec of the three priest trees. Its focus is on DoT (damage over time) spells such as Shadow Word: Pain and channeled DoTs such as Mind Flay. Shadow priests are also capable of dealing high burst damage with Mind Blast (their main nuking spell) and Shadow Word: Death (a secondary nuking spell that also deals self damage to the priest if the spell does not kill the enemy). The most important spell of the Shadow tree is Shadow Form. The spell when cast transforms the priest into a shadowy form which increases the damage they do with shadow spells and reduces the damage they receive as well as the threat generated by shadow spells.<\/p><ul><li><b>Role:<\/b> Healer, Ranged Magic Damage Dealer<\/li><li><b>Available Races:<\/b><i>Alliance:<\/i> Draenei, Dwarf, Gnome, Human, Night Elf, Worgen<br \/><i>Horde:<\/i> Blood Elf, Goblin, Tauren, Orc, Troll, Forsaken<\/li><li><b>Available Armor:<\/b> Cloth<\/li><li><b>Available Weapons:<\/b> Daggers, One-Handed Maces, Staves, Wands<\/li><li><b>Talent trees:<\/b> Discipline - Holy - Shadow<\/li><\/ul><h3>Rogue<\/h3><p style=\"\">Lore-wise, rogues are assassins, hitmen, or spies. They're primarily melee fighters, but they employ minor mysticism in order to pull off abilities such as Cloak of Shadows (enter a shadow form and dispel many harmful magical effects) or Shadowstep (teleport behind an enemy and increase damage dealt by next attack). Their signature abilities such as ambush (a hard-hitting stab from behind while in stealth) require the player to use daggers, but rogues are free to use one-handed maces, swords and axes as well. In groups, a rogue will be responsible for dealing damage. Sometimes rogues will sap something to incapacitate it so the group can deal with other foes first. Rogues also have a misdirection type ability in \"Tricks of the Trade\" that gives a damage buff and threat to a chosen target for a limited amount of time. Unlike any of the other classes, rogues use energy instead of a mana or rage in the case of the warrior. The rogue expends energy upon using any special ability, and energy regenerates over time automatically. The rogue also uses poisons to enchant their weapons and cause a variety of effects on their targets. Rogues are the only class that have the ability to pick locks, which they need to train to unlock higher level chests.<\/p><ul><li><b>Role:<\/b> Melee Damage Dealer<\/li><li><b>Available Races:<\/b><i>Alliance:<\/i> Dwarf, Gnome, Human, Night Elf, Worgen<br \/><i>Horde:<\/i> Blood Elf, Goblin, Orc, Troll, Forsaken<\/li><li><b>Available Armor:<\/b> Cloth, Leather<\/li><li><b>Available Weapons:<\/b> Bows, Crossbows, Daggers, Fist Weapons, Guns, One-Handed Axes, One-Handed Maces, One-Handed Swords<\/li><li><b>Talent trees:<\/b> Assassination - Combat - Subtlety<\/li><\/ul><h3>Shaman<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37487\/1172163-shaman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1172163\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37487\/1172163-shaman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1172163\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37487\/1172163-shaman.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Troll Shaman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Shaman is a hybrid class with the ability of spell casting, melee combat, and healing.

One of their key techniques is the ability to summon several demonic minions to aid them in combat. Examples of such minions are the Voidwalker which controls aggro of the enemy NPC, the Felguard, which is a warrior-like damage pet, and the Felhunter who possesses the ability to remove magical buffs from the enemy target.<\/p><ul><li><b>Role:<\/b> Ranged Magic Damage Dealer<\/li><li><b>Available Races:<\/b><i>Alliance:<\/i> Dwarf, Gnome, Human, Worgen<br \/><i>Horde:<\/i> Blood Elf, Goblin, Orc, Troll, Forsaken<\/li><li><b>Available Armor:<\/b> Cloth<\/li><li><b>Available Weapons:<\/b> Daggers, One-Handed Swords, Staves, Wands<\/li><li><b>Talent trees:<\/b> Affliction - Demonology - Destruction<\/li><\/ul><h3>Warrior<\/h3><p style=\"\">Available to all but one of the games' races. Warriors have access to a wide range of special abilities, which they activate by using a unique energy mechanic known as rage. The Warrior enters combat with an empty pool of Rage, remaining so until they block, deal or receive damage, at which point the Rage pool begins to fill. Once enough Rage is accumulated the warrior is able to access their combat skills, spending the pool like the mana or energy of the other classes. Warriors have 3 combat stances: Defensive, Battle, and Berserker stance. Depending on what the situation calls for, these stances let the Warrior adapt to the task at hand. Warriors that are in a raiding guild primarily focus on tanking with the Protection spec, but warriors are also capable of performing high DPS with the Fury and Arms spec.<\/p><ul><li><b>Role:<\/b> Tank, Melee Damage Dealer<\/li><li><b>Available Races:<\/b><i>Alliance:<\/i> Draenei, Dwarf, Gnome, Human, Night Elf, Worgen<br \/><i>Horde:<\/i> Blood Elf, Goblin, Orc, Tauren, Troll, Forsaken<\/li><li><b>Available Armor:<\/b> Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate<\/li><li><b>Available Weapons:<\/b> Bows, Crossbows, Daggers, Fist Weapons, Guns, One-Handed Axes, One-Handed Maces, One-Handed Swords, Polearms, Staves, Two-Handed Axes, Two-Handed Maces, Two-Handed Swords, Shields<\/li><li><b>Talent trees:<\/b> Arms - Fury - Protection<\/li><\/ul><h3>Death Knight*<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37487\/1171569-deathknight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171569\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/37487\/1171569-deathknight.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171569\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/37487\/1171569-deathknight.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Undead Death Knight<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Death Knight is the first hero class of World of Warcraft.

High level alchemists have the option to perform transmutations which is a very popular area of Alchemy, they give the player an option to transmute certain materials into other materials of the same category for example you could transmute an Eternal Air into an Eternal Earth; this also gives a chance of discovering new recipes.

Blacksmithing is very well paired with the Mining profession, it gathers many items such as ores and jewels which will be needed to skill up Blacksmithing.<br \/>Once a Blacksmith has reached high enough skill they have the option to learn a specilization, however as of the moment this only supports level 60-70 items.<br \/><ul><li><b>Armorsmith<\/b> - The Blacksmith is able to learn how to craft more powerful armor items.<\/li><li><b>Weaponsmith<\/b> - The Blacksmith is able to learn how to craft more powerful weapons.<br \/><ul><li><i>Axesmith<\/i> - Further Weaponsmithing specialization allowing for the crafting of more powerful axes.<\/li><li><i>Hammersmith<\/i> - Further Weaponsmithing specialization allowing for the crafting of more powerful maces.<\/li><li><i>Swordsmith<\/i> - Further Weaponsmithing specialization allowing for crafting of more powerful swords.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Enchanting<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14440\/1468779-enchanting.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468779\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14440\/1468779-enchanting.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468779\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14440\/1468779-enchanting.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Enchanting<\/figcaption><\/figure> Offers the ability to permanently augment a character's equipment boosting their stats.

It can be easily farmed. Financial benefit of the profession comes mainly from the bags they can create and the \"spellthread\" leg enchant items. Every character is required to have bags if they want to progress smoothly through the game therefore bags are in high demand. The spellthread items are the primary way to enchant leg-slot armor items with effects ideal for spellcasting classes.

This buff is critical to maximizing character potential when raiding. Other food may have special effects such as transforming your character into a pirate or periodic emissions of lightning for a duration.

Once a bandage has been used on a player they will recieve a 60 second debuff that prevents that player from being healed by a bandage while the debuff is active. Just like the food created from the Cooking skill, bandages are a great way to reduce downtime and conserve mana especially whilst questing but also in raid situations as well. An advantage of First Aid bandages compared to food is that bandages can be used in combat, this makes them a valuable item in PvP for players to sneakily use while the opposing players aren't aware of it.

Certain aquatic raid bosses must be fished up to initiate the fight. Even though it sounds like a useless skill, many of the fish are required to level up cooking making it a valuable companion for those who don't want to spend money on the auction house for what can often be expensive materials. In addition, the food and feasts granting the most powerful buffs at end-game are created from fish.<br \/>For a player to fish they require a fishing rod which can be purchased from vendors or aquired through quests, the player must then equip the rod and select the fishing skill from their toolbar whilst positioned next to fishable water, the rod will then be cast into the water and the waiting starts. For a period of around 20 seconds a channeling bar will count down and at some point during this the fish bait will bob in the water signalling for the player to click on it and see what loot they have recieved from the cast.<br \/>Different fish can be caught in different zones and sometimes different lakes within a zone will also be a factor. You will find the fish you need early on for progressing through Cooking will be fished from the early level zones and the higher skill Cooking recipes will be fished from the higher level zones. It possible to use certain items that will increase your fishing skill, for example you can buy fishing lures that are temporary buffs placed on your fishing rod to increase your skill while other skill increases can already be found on certain fishing rods or glove enchantments. In some end-game areas, a lure is required as the necessary fishing skill is higher than the current maximum skill achievable in the game.<br \/>Similarly to Cooking, you can recieve Fishing daily quests from <a href=\"\/shattrath-city\/3035-163\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-163\">Shattrath<\/a> and <a href=\"\/dalaran\/3035-131\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-131\">Dalaran<\/a> which reward random epics gems, fishing apparel\/rods, vanity pets, recipes, cash, and various trash items.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Dungeons<\/h2><p style=\"\">Here's a list of every dungeon in the game as of December 2010.

The main reason that they are used is because you get 20% more experience from quests and monsters, when wearing both the shoulder slot and the chest slot.

Here some of them are explained in detail:<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Brewfest<\/h3> Brewfest is an annual event, a festival that celebrates drinking alchoholic beverages and eating fine food, and is roughly analogous to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oktoberfest\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oktoberfest<\/a>. Brewfest pops up in Fall, outside all the major cities of <a href=\"..\/..\/azeroth\/95-61\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azeroth<\/a> that can be celebrated by both the Alliance and the Horde.There are two major celebrations that are set up outside of Ironforge and Orgimmar, but there are also smaller celebrations at Stormwind, the <i>Exodar<\/i>, Shattrath City, Thunder Bluff, the Undercity, Darnassus, and Silvermoon City. Brewfest is celebrated every year between September 20 and October 4, and during this time, players can play game like Ram Racing where they race against the clock on the back of a surprisingly fast large animal. If they win the game, the players can earn Brewfest tokens that they can then exchange for great in-game prizes. But players should make sure to spend their earned Brewfest tokens before the event is over because when that happens, the tokens are pretty much useless until next year when the event happens again.<\/td><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/720\/865867-wow_brewfest.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865867\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/720\/865867-wow_brewfest.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865867\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/720\/865867-wow_brewfest.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Hallow's End<\/h3> A celebration of all things spooky, coincidentally held around Halloween, Hallow's End is a holiday that is celebrated by all the innkeepers and vendors of Azeroth and the Outlands, between October 18th and November 1st. Hallow's End is not an exclusive holiday, so both the Alliance and the Horde factions can be part of the seasonal festivities. During this holiday, players can go up to any innkeeper and get a Treat-bag that may contain either a surprising gift or a nasty trick. But if asking innkeepers for free candy isn't your style, you can always go up to the vendors in Ironforge or Orgrimmar and buy all the candy you like. However, if your in the charitable mood during the celebration, there is Jesper in Stormwind and Spoops in Orgrimmar who aren't able to celebrate Hallow's End because they are orphans. Players can help those two orphans by taking the treats they get from innkeepers and giving them to the two sad orphans.<\/td><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/720\/866049-the_heedleess_dude.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-866049\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/720\/866049-the_heedleess_dude.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-866049\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/720\/866049-the_heedleess_dude.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Headless Horseman<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>The Feast of Winter Veil<\/h3> Starting in December and ending in January, the Feast of Winter Veil is a celebration where Greatfather Winter, travels to most of the great cities of Azeroth like Ironforge and Orgrimmar to spread (Christmas) holiday cheer. During this time period, all of the dungeon bosses will wear festive red and green hats, that players can get for themselves if they can kill them. Also, Innkeepers will decorate their inns with (Christmas) lights of many different colors. But the real celebrations start on December 25th and go until January 2, in which the goblins of Smokeywood Pastures sneak into town and leave gifts under the decorated trees in Ironforge and Orgrimmar. But Players must be quick because these gifts are there for the taking and might get snatched up before you get the chance.<br \/><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Love is in the Air<\/h3><p style=\"\">Love is in the Air is the World of Warcraft version of Valentine's Day. It is an annual event that lasts from February 6th through February 20th. Love is in the Air is a vanity holiday and features no items that give a player serious gameplay advantage. For the duration of this holiday players must carry an item in their inventory to collect heart charms from honor and experience granting enemies. These charms are then turned into charm bracelets and traded at a one to one ratio to a holiday vendor for love tokens. A player with enough love tokens can purchase a variety of in-game novelty items ranging from fireworks to clothing. Love tokens can also be earned by completing special holiday related quests or killing the holiday boss: Apothecary Hummel.<\/p><h3>New Years<\/h3> New Years is a short holiday taking place from December 31st through January 1st. This holiday features relatively little in comparison to some of the more prolific events. Players can view wondrous firework displays from cities around Azeroth and are encouraged to sample the drinks brewed up especially for this holiday. The goblin guards of Booty Bay are always found drunk at their posts this time of year, turning this neutral zone into a PvP wasteland.<br \/><h3>Pilgrim's Bounty<\/h3> Pilgrim's Bounty occurs between November 20th and 26th and is representative of American Thanksgiving. This event revolves heavily around cooking various holiday related recipes. There are six daily quests related to this holiday and each one involves cooking a different holiday recipe. Due to the nature of the holiday it is an easy way for players to train their cooking skill from 1 to 355, this allows a player to achieve grand master level cooking in a relatively short amount of time.<br \/><h3>Children's Week<\/h3> Children's Week occurs every year between May 2nd and May 8th and is one of the oldest holidays in World of Warcraft. Like most other in-game holidays Children's Week has a real life counterpart in Japan's Children Day, held on May 5th. This holiday revolves around orphans from both the Horde and Alliance. Players must first visit the Orphan Matron in either Stormwind or Orgrimmar (later Shattrath City and Dalaran with the addition of additional Children's Week quests) to receive their orphan. Once a player has attained their orphan they are tasked with doing various quests given to them by the orphan. These range from buying them sweets to taking them to a beautiful in game location. Once the player has completed all of the orphans quests they return them to the orphanage and receive one in game pet. Multiple pets are available from the same quest making it impossible to acquire them all without taking part in the holiday over multiple years. With the release of the Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King expansions two new orphans week quest givers were added with different objectives and pets.<br \/><h3>Lunar Festival<\/h3> The Lunar Festival was added in 2006 and lasts from January 23rd through February 13th. Most of the holiday events revolve around Coins of Ancestry, a holiday specific form of currency. Coins of Ancestry are gained by honoring various elders scattered throughout Azeroth. Elders can be found in all of the main cities as well as scattered in smaller cities across the world. Coins of Ancestry can be spent in Moonglade for fireworks, holiday clothing and festival specific food. Tailors and engineers can also buy the patterns for various holiday outfits and firework launchers. Besides the elders, the Lunar Festival also features the outdoor boss Omen, a boss usually killed by a large raid or in cooperative effort between Horde and Alliance players.<br \/><h3>Midsummer Fire Festival<\/h3><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Midsummer Fire Festival takes place between June 21st and July 4th ending with a glorious Fourth of July themed fireworks show. Much like other holidays, the Midsummer Fire Festival features a holiday currency, this time in the form of Burning Blossoms. Burning Blossoms can be exchanged for holiday specific food, clothing and in game pets and novelty items. Low-level players can also take advantage of ribbon poles scattered throughout Azeroth. When these poles are used they provide a 10% experience boost for the duration of the buff (up to 60 minutes). This time around the holiday boss takes the form of Lord Ahune, a frost elemental who can be summoned into the Slave Pens. Unlike other holiday bosses, Lord Ahune drops items that are viable to be used as actual gear on a level 85 player.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Game Expansions<\/h2><p style=\"\">As any other MMORPG, <i>World of Warcraft<\/i> has also received additional expansion packs.

Arguably the biggest change was making the Paladin and Shaman classes available to both factions, thus balancing the two factions in terms of class availability. The expansion also introduced arenas, which allowed players to team up with their friends and compete against others in gladiatorial styled matches .

corrupted blood incident is one of the most infamous glitches in WoW history, partially because it resembled a actual epidemic. Because of this it drew the attention of international press world wide, even non-gaming related press. Epidemiologist Ran D. Balicer even published an article in the journal 'Epidemiology' comparing it to SARS and avian influenza outbreaks. Wherein he suggested that RPGs could be used as an advanced platform as a model for the dissemination of infectious diseases. The link was also made between terrorist attacks. Charles Blair, deputy director of the Center for Terrorism and Intelligence Studies, felt that WoW could provide a new way to study how terrorist cells form and operate.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/61151\/1341849-plague_500x401.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1341849\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/61151\/1341849-plague_500x401.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1341849\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/61151\/1341849-plague_500x401.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The AH in Orgrimmar during the event<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The plague began on September 13th 2005. When Blizzard added a new dungeon called \"Zul Gurub\" to the game. The final boss of this dungeon, 'Hakkar', could cast a spell called 'Corrupted Blood'. This would place a poison or 'Debuff' on the player character that would cause a certain amount of damage overtime (in this case a fair large amount due to it being created for end game purposes), but could also transfer to other players. This would mean that when players fought Hakkar they had to position themselves in certain ways in order to succeed.<\/p><p style=\"\">The spell was originally designed to work during the boss encounter in Zul Gurub. However players who had the debuff were able to take it outside the dungeon and infect other players. This meant that people either died from the debuff or simply got it again after the timer expired from another player. Players who were low level would die almost instantly if they came into contact with an infected player. \"Non player characters\" could also contract the disease. Though they didn't receive any damage from it, they were able to infect other players.<\/p><p style=\"\">The end result was literally hundreds of bodies littered across the heavy populated areas of the game, as well as making large areas of the game inaccessible on some servers. Although death is not permanent in WoW, there are disadvantages when you die and it is considered annoying. Player reactions varied enormously. While some players with healing powers offered their help, many low level players avoided heavy populated areas or just stopped playing for the duration of the incident. Others took advantage of the chaos and deliberately tried to infect as many players as possible. Blizzard originally built a quarantine zone in the hope of containing the disease. However some players worked around this by healing themselves long enough to spread the disease outside. A Blizzard employee posted the following on the WoW forums:<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\">It appears that the hotfix remedy concocted to combat the recent Azerothain outbreak has not yet yielded the desired results. At this time, our medical staff is continuing to develop an effective cure. We look forward to ensuring the health and vitality of the citizens of Azeroth in the near future.<\/p><\/blockquote><p style=\"\">Eventually Blizzard had to do a hard reset on all of its servers and patch the game to remove the spreading infection.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg"},"name":"World of Warcraft"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Bully: Scholarship Edition is a direct port of Canis Canem Edit, or <a href=\"\/bully\/3030-10281\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10281\"> Bully<\/a> as it was also known, from the Playstation 2.

The game relies heavily on minigames that take the role of different school classes. Each class has its own benefit for succeeding. For example, being proficient in English means you can talk your way out of a misdemeanor.<\/p><p style=\"\">You may also earn weapons as your progress. However, unlike in Grand Theft Auto, you do not earn guns. You get weapons a schoolboy may possess, such as a Slingshot. Rather than killing other characters as well, you merely knock them out.

Not only this, but you may earn different vehicles too. Initially you get a Skateboard early in the game, but you will eventually get bikes as well. You can also win a Go Kart, and purchase a Scooter. As you progress you earn the ability to buy more clothing and equipment for Jimmy. Eventually you can also purchase tattoos for him. You will unlock different areas of the town through game progression, and these areas are:<\/p><ul><li>Bullworth Town<\/li><li>Trailer Park<\/li><li>Asylum<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">As you progress through Bully, you will earn money, which you can spend on different equipment. For example, you may purchase Stinkbombs and other such goods to resupply your inventory. Not only this, but there is a fair that opens up when you reach the town area, and take part in one of the Preppie missions. At the fair you can take part in different fairground activities, which will earn you tickets. These tickets can then be redeemed at the store in the fair for exclusive prizes, such as the Scooter, and different posters which can decorate Jimmy's room in the school. Should you choose to purchase a bike in-game, apart from the Scooter (which is the fastest bike you can get), the best all round bike is the Aquaberry, as it has the best blend of stats. Generally, most of the AI opponents will not be using the Aquaberry Bike, which already puts you at an advantage.<\/p><h2>Classes<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are 10 different classes in Bully: Scholarship Edition, and they all have five levels each.

However they do not use any weapons, so they are easily outclassed at range with the Slingshot and other such weapons.

They will start fights regardless of their odds of winning.<\/p><h2>Collectibles<\/h2><p style=\"\">Like all Rockstar games, there are a multitude of different collectibles for you to hunt down. Unsurprisingly, they are all needed for the 100% completion. Bully: Scholarship Edition makes this an easier task through the inclusion of the Geography class, which awards the player with item locations on their map as they progress through the class.<\/p><h3>Rubber Bands<\/h3><p style=\"\">Around the world you may find blue rubber bands. There are 75 of them, and when you collect all of them you get a rubber band ball. This ball is the best weapon in the game as it one hits everyone, including Jocks.<\/p><h3>Grottos and Gremlins Cards<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are hidden cards from a game the Nerd clique loves, called Goblins and Gremlins (reference to Dungeons and Dragons, clearly). Once you collect all these cards you receive a unique themed costume.<\/p><h3>Gnomes<\/h3><p style=\"\">Around the area of Bullworth there are 25 gnomes. Destroying all of them will earn you a gnome costume.<\/p><h3>Transistors<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are six radio transistors that you should aim to collect.

The game is credited for revolutionizing the role-playing genre, and many of today's Role Playing Games use the story- and <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene<\/a>-heavy model as a blueprint. The game originally shipped on three CDs. The extra space was required for the game's pre-rendered video content. Though role-playing games had an American audience throughout the 8- and 16-bit eras, many credit Final Fantasy VII for the genre's current level of popularity, as the game's beautiful pre-rendered <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/full-motion-video\/3015-604\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\">Full Motion Video<\/a> (FMV) cutscenes and wide epic scope were unlike anything that had come before it. Its critical and commercial success paved the way for the rise of cinematic storytelling in the video game industry. Final Fantasy VII also played an instrumental role in the PlayStation's victory over the <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64<\/a>; it was originally intended for the N64, but due to its cartridge limitations, Final Fantasy VII instead became the PlayStation's killer app.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy VII revolves around a company named <a href=\"..\/..\/shinra-electric-power-company\/92-53\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shinra<\/a> that is drawing from the very life of the planet to create energy called <a href=\"..\/..\/mako\/92-1241\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mako<\/a> to power its technology. This process is causing widespread ecological problems. The main character, <a href=\"..\/..\/cloud-strife\/94-321\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloud Strife<\/a>, is a mercenary. He is hired by a rebel group, <a href=\"..\/..\/avalanche\/92-1506\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AVALANCHE<\/a> , to destroy Shinra's <a href=\"..\/..\/mako-reactor\/93-990\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mako reactors<\/a> in an attempt to slow down the planet's decay.

Along the way, Cloud and his group discover that Mako comes from the life energy of the planet, called the <a href=\"..\/..\/lifestream\/92-1509\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lifestream<\/a>. When the planet is injured, the energy from the Lifestream focuses on that injury to heal the planet. To make things even more troubling, <a href=\"..\/..\/sephiroth\/94-511\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sephiroth<\/a>, Cloud's former partner and the most powerful <a href=\"..\/..\/soldier\/92-1237\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOLDIER<\/a> on the planet, plans to cause a planet-wide catastrophe by summoning <a href=\"..\/..\/meteor\/93-1142\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meteor<\/a> to crash into the earth so he can draw all the Mako energy released to himself and gain god-like power.<\/p><h2>Combat<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207912\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207912\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/3689\/207912-ffvii_8__before.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>PHS: changing the party lineup.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy VII introduced an updated version of the combat system from previous Final Fantasy titles.

Players collect magical orbs of pure Mako energy that contain magic. They would level up along with the characters, getting stronger, introducing better and more advanced moves and eventually even spawning another orb of the same name. You attach Materia to the available slots on the two types of equipment (Weapons\/Accessory) any of the characters have on at the time. Depending on the types of slots (single\/combined) you could create some powerful combinations of magic characters can use to devastate the battlefield. For example, a combined Materia slot could have the magic \"Bolt\" in one side and \"All\" on the other, creating a magic attack that would strike all the enemies on the screen at once with electricity. Some of the more powerful Materia in the game required many hours of searching or side-questing. These were usually worth seeking because they allowed players to perform some of the more powerful moves in the game. Special weapons like Apocalypse, Scimitar and accessories also had the ability to gain double, or even triple AP, allowing the player to level Materia more quickly. Many of the more powerful types of Materia would summon creatures to attack your enemies with some of the game's flashiest attacks.<\/p><h3>Materia<\/h3><p style=\"\">In general, purple Materia enhance the character's Status; blue Materia are effective when used paired with other Materia in linked slots. and yellow Materia increase the number of commands that can be used.<\/p><table><thead><tr><th>Interdependent (purple)<\/th><th>Support (blue)<\/th><th>Command (yellow)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Cover<\/td><td>All<\/td><td>Steal<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chocobo Love<\/td><td>Elemental<\/td><td>Sense<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Long Range<\/td><td>Added Effect<\/td><td>Enemy Skill<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Counter<\/td><td>HP Absorb<\/td><td>Throw<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enemy Lure<\/td><td>MP Absorb<\/td><td>Manipulate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Speed Plus<\/td><td>Added Cut<\/td><td>Deathblow<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MP Plus<\/td><td>MP Turbo<\/td><td>Morph<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>HP Plus<\/td><td>Steal as Well<\/td><td>Double Cut<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Luck Plus<\/td><td>Magic Counter<\/td><td>Master Command<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Magic Plus<\/td><td>Final Attack<\/td><td>Slash-All<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gil Plus<\/td><td>Quadra Magic<\/td><td>Mime<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pre-Emptive<\/td><td>Sneak Attack<\/td><td>X-Magic<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Exp.

When she reunites with Cloud, she persuades him to join AVALANCHE and makes sure to keep an eye on him during their first mission attacking the Mako Reactor.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b><u>Limit Breaks<\/u><\/b><\/p><table><thead><tr><th>Level 1<\/th><th>Level 2<\/th><th>Level 3<\/th><th>Level 4<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Beat Rush<\/td><td>Waterkick<\/td><td>Dolphin Blow<\/td><td>Final Heaven<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Somersault<\/td><td>Meteodrive<\/td><td>Meteor Strike<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Aerith Gainsborough<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7383\/2280212-aerith_ffvii.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2280212\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7383\/2280212-aerith_ffvii.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2280212\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/7383\/2280212-aerith_ffvii.png\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/aerith-gainsborough\/3005-784\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-784\">Aeris Gainsborough<\/a> (\"Aerith\" in Japan) is 22 years old and lived in Midgar selling flowers in the slums below the Mako Reactor that was AVALACHE's first mission target.

He was revered as the best that SOLDIER had to offer and was hailed as a hero for his service to Shinra. Sephiroth fell from grace when he discovered his true origins and the circumstances surrounding the way he was actually 'made'. While he was in the womb of <a href=\"\/lucrecia-crescent\/3005-3070\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3070\">Lucrecia<\/a> (his mother) he was injected with <a href=\"\/jenova\/3005-4832\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4832\">Jenova<\/a> cells - Jenova being an alien life form that is often mistaken as a member of the <a href=\"\/cetra\/3015-1740\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1740\">Cetra<\/a>, or the first humans to have lived on the planet. When Sephiroth found out he was a creation of Shinra, he lost his mind. He assumed himself to be an Ancient as Jenova was his actual mother. With this in mind he plotted a scheme to become god and exact his revenge on mankind. He planned to do this by calling <a href=\"\/meteor\/3055-1142\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1142\">Meteor<\/a> (the black Materia) to destroy the planet. When Meteor hits the planet the Lifestream will expel an incredible amount of energy to heal the shattered planet. Sephiroth's goal is to become one with the life energy, thus becoming a god.

Two thousand years before the games main events Jenova crash landed on the planet on a meteor. On the planet the Cetra, i.e. the ancients, were inhabiting at the time, Jenova used its abilities to trick the Cetra, killing them off one by one. In a desperate struggle, the remaining Cetra used all their power and locked away the life form in the Northern Crater (which was created when Jenova landed there in the first place). In the present day Jenova was rediscovered by Professor Gast and mistook as a Cetra. He used the Jenova life form in a project called 'The Jenova Project' where Jenova Cells were infused inside Lucrecia's womb. This is when Sephiroth was born. Jenova was stored at the Shinra Headquarters at the start of the game, and from there Sephiroth dragged it away and kept the head with him.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/rufus-shinra\/94-2651\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rufus Shinra<\/a> ( <a href=\"..\/..\/shinra-electric-power-company\/92-53\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shinra Co.<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Rufus Shinra was 25 years old at the start of Final Fantasy VII.

The game was originally planned as a 2D game on the SNES, that was not the only major change to how the game eventually turned out. The Creator of Final Fantasy, <a href=\"..\/..\/hironobu-sakaguchi\/72-633\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hironobu Sakaguchi<\/a> originally intended for the game to take place in present day New York City. Development on the game was stalled, due to priority going over to the <a href=\"..\/..\/chrono-trigger\/61-9249\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chrono Trigger<\/a> project that was being developed at the same time.<\/p><p style=\"\">Development recommenced later on in 1995. The original script saw a major overview, with a detective story theme being cast aside and co-director, <a href=\"..\/..\/yoshinori-kitase\/72-634\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoshinori Kitase<\/a>, pushed for the game to go 3D for concerns that the series would be left behind back in the 2D era. Also, it was decided to make the game for Nintendo\u2019s next console, the N64. Though due to FFVII\u2019s ambitious design, Square expressed concerns to Nintendo over their decision to use cartridges instead of a new format capable of storing much more information, called CD-ROM\u2019s, on their new console. This dispute continued and led to Square announcing on the 12 of January 1996, that it would be dropping relations with Nintendo and developing FFVII on Sony\u2019s debut console, the Playstation. A reported $45,000,000 was spent over the extent of the games development.<\/p><h2>Sales<\/h2><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy VII was a huge commercial success. In Japan, the game moved 2.3 million units in three days. The game sold a million copies in the US in its first four months. Final Fantasy VII is the highest selling Final Fantasy game with sales reaching over 9.8 million as of December 2005.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Availability on the PlayStation Network<\/h2><p style=\"\">On April 10th 2009, Final Fantasy 7 was released onto the Japanese PSN Store for 1,500 Yen. On June 3rd 2009, Final Fantasy 7 was released for the European and American PSN stores for \u20ac9.99 and $9.99 respectively. This announcement was made days before during Sony's press conference of E3 2009. June 4th Marked the release of FF7 on the UK PSN store for the price of \u00a37.99.<\/p><h2>PC Releases and Requirements<\/h2><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy VII was published for Windows 95 by Eidos not long after the original Playstation release, in June of 1998, coming on multiple CDs like its console counterpart did. This version was largely intact in comparison to the console release, with a few differences:<\/p><ul><li>Polygonal graphics were smoother, employing texture filtering and taking advantage of the PC's higher resolution, if you had a 3D accelerator<\/li><li>Pre-rendered graphics appeared grainier due to the low resolution of the renders juxtaposed with higher native resolution of computer monitors<\/li><li>Soundtrack was output in MIDI format; quality of orchestration was thus dependent on the PC's sound card (a hack was later made available to import the Playstation sound file library such that the music was rendered to sound exactly how it did on consoles)<\/li><li>Localization was cleaned up, removing the poor grammar, missing words, and misspellings of the original console release<\/li><li>Game's aesthetics were moddable, thanks to homebrew hacks, such that different character models, combat areas and sound themes could be applied providing for a more modern look and feel<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Square Enix then re-released this PC version in August of 2012, exclusively from its online store as a digital download. The differences between console version and initial PC release apply with this re-release as well; in other words, backgrounds are still low-res and music is still MIDI. With this re-release, the following further changes apply:<\/p><ul><li>36 achievements are integrated into the game<\/li><li>Character booster gives players the option to increase their character stats and money without restriction should they desire to just play through the plot (i.e. cheat through the game)<\/li><li>Support for cloud saves<\/li><li>The game is no longer moddable natively and must undergo a total conversion process to the \"old\" version of the game in order to be modded (doing this removes the achievements, character booster, and cloud saves)<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><b>Original Windows requirements (1998)<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Windows 95 with DirectX 5.1 installed;<\/li><li>Pentium 166 (without 3D accelerator card), Pentium 133 (with 3D accelerator card);<\/li><li>260MB Hard drive space (standard install), 460MB (maximum install);<\/li><li>32MB RAM;<\/li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible SVGA video card;<\/li><li>100% Windows 95 compatible 4x CD-ROM drive;<\/li><li>100% DirectX 5.1 compatible sound card configured to playback digital and MIDI audio.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><b>Re-release Windows Requirements (2012)<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Microsoft Windows XP\/Vista\/7 (32\/64-bit)<\/li><li>At least 2GHz CPU<\/li><li>At least 1GB RAM<\/li><li>DirectX 9-compatible GPU<\/li><\/ul><h2>Remake<\/h2><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy VII is a popular game in the series, and due to this rumours of a remake to the next generation consoles was imminent.

Next was the game <a href=\"\/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii\/3030-5571\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5571\">Dirge of Cerberus<\/a> released in 2006 on the <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2<\/a>, which describes the story of optional character <a href=\"\/vincent-valentine\/3005-788\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-788\">Vincent Valentine<\/a>. It takes place before Advent Children and describes his relationship with Lucrecia Crescent (Sephiroth's mother) in detail. Next was the game Crisis Core released in 2007 for the Playstation Portable. It takes place before the original Final Fantasy VII, with the main protagonist being Zack Fair. Zack had a intimate reltaionship with Aerith Gainsborough and was best friends with Cloud. It shows the story of his struggle and also how Cloud ended up in Midgar for the start of Final Fantasy VII. Relating to the game Crisis Core, there also was a OVA (original video animation) of the stories of Zack and Cloud, and how they managed to end up in Midgar. It is a 25 minute video which basically shows the ending the Crisis Core in anime form. The ending for Crisis Core was different from the Last Order OVA which was released first.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1814630-box_ff7.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1814630-box_ff7.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1814630-box_ff7.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1814630-box_ff7.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1814630-box_ff7.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1814630-box_ff7.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1814630-box_ff7.png"},"name":"Final Fantasy VII"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1119846-russ_shadowmoses.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119846\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1119846-russ_shadowmoses.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119846\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/4527\/1119846-russ_shadowmoses.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Shadow Moses<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Metal Gear Solid is a 3D espionage third-person action-adventure game developed by <a href=\"\/konami-computer-entertainment-japan-inc\/3010-2065\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2065\">KCE Japan<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/konami-corporation\/3010-87\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Sony PlayStation<\/a> on October 21, 1998.

Like its predecessor, Metal Gear Solid is a game which revolves around <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a>, so <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Snake<\/a> will spend most of his time avoiding enemy detection. Utilizing his ability to walk quietly, crawl, and press against walls, Snake can avoid attracting enemy attention. Snake can also take out enemies by grabbing them and knocking them out, or utilizing the variety of weapons in his arsenal to take them down. Unfortunately, making any sort of noise will alert other guards in <a href=\"\/shadow-moses\/3035-41\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-41\">Shadow Moses<\/a>. If Snake is detected, the game will go into alert phase, bringing extra guards to the area as long as alert mode is active. In this mode, Snake must either fight or make flight, though most often, he must escape, as he is at a disadvantage. If Snake manages to sneak away, the game enters the evasion phase in which the guards will be actively searching for Snake, though they are not aware of his presence. If Snake can hide long enough, the game will go to normal sneaking mode. If Snake is found in evasion phase, the game will return to alert status. In both alert and evasion phases, Snake cannot use his Soliton <a href=\"\/radar\/3015-3542\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3542\">radar<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Like in Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, the Soliton radar becomes a handy tool for Snake, showing him enemy positions and their respective vision cones, therefore making it easier for him to avoid detection. In alert, evasion, and jamming phases, the radar becomes unusable. Snake has no radar in the harder difficulty levels of the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">The player moves Snake around the environment using the D-pad or analog sticks, which are also used to look around when in <a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first person mode<\/a>. The first person mode is initiated by pressing the triangle button. To sneak around, Snake will often be crawling, initiated by pressing the X button. The X button also allows snake to crouch, which allows him to stay out of sight behind short boxes or other objects. Snake can press against walls as well, a technique often used for sneaking. By holding the X button and the shoot button, Snake can shoot while running. With his back to the wall, Snake can use the square button to knock on walls, which will attract enemy attention, possibly allowing Snake to sneak off in the other direction.<\/p><p style=\"\">Snake's inventory is sorted into two menus on the left and right side of the screen. The right menu shows all weapons currently in Snake's inventory, while the left menu shows all other items Snake is carrying. The player uses the L2 button to bring up the item menu, and the R2 button to bring up the weapons. When the player brings up either menu, the game pauses, the inventory borders the screen, and it can be navigated with the D-pad. The L1 and R1 buttons are used from weapon and item quick changes. Snake is able to use many weapons throughout his mission, including <a href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistols<\/a> and <a href=\"\/claymore\/3055-1272\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1272\">claymores<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355632\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355632\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The codec<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">To access his <a href=\"\/codec\/3015-2355\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2355\">codec<\/a>, the player presses the select button. Often throughout the game, the codec will ring and a message will display, informing the player that they have received a call. Pressing the select button will answer the call. Whenever the player needs to save or consult any of the other characters, he can access the codec menu and then either choose from saved frequencies or search for a frequency manually. The codec is very important, both for saving and telling the story.<\/p><p style=\"\">The circle and square buttons are used for combat. The square button is the weapon button, and when pressed, Snake will fire the equipped weapon. Without any weapons equipped, Snake can use the square button to throw or choke an enemy he has grabbed. The circle button will unleash Snake's devastating punch and kick combo. Snake will attack in the direction he is facing, which is altered using the D-pad or analog sticks.<\/p><p style=\"\">One of the most memorable aspects of Metal Gear Solid is the unusual pieces of gameplay that go beyond stealth. The game introduces the <a href=\"\/torture\/3015-2574\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2574\">torture<\/a> event, which became a staple for later titles. While being tortured, the player has to press a button repeatedly to keep Snake alive (Also known as ''Button Mashing'' sequences). The game also has sequences borrowed from its predecessor Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, including ones that take Snake's equipment away, require Snake to rappel down a building, and other off-beat sequences. Snake will find his mission is much more difficult then simply avoiding enemy detection.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is one known difference between the US and Japanese versions of MGS1 on the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSX<\/a>. In the Japanese version, if you dial the codec frequency to 140.66 in the Snowfield, and two other locations, it plays a song. One song sounds like a laggy broken version of the theme from <a href=\"\/metal-gear-2-solid-snake\/3030-723\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-723\">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake<\/a>. You can access this song from the Snowfield outside of the Hangar when you first encounter <a href=\"\/vulcan-raven\/3005-873\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-873\">Vulcan Raven<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Memorable Moments<\/h2><h3><a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/meryl-silverburgh\/3005-440\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-440\">Meryl<\/a>'s Frequency<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/201\/548083-mgs_back.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-548083\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/201\/548083-mgs_back.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-548083\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/201\/548083-mgs_back.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">At one moment during the game, players are required to physically look at the game's packaging. The back cover of the CD case contains a screenshot of the codec featuring Snake conversing with Meryl; this screenshot contains the frequency that the players must use in the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">This particular moment was largely borrowed from the game's predecessor, <a href=\"\/metal-gear-2-solid-snake\/3030-723\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-723\">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake<\/a>, which featured a similarly fourth-wall-breaking moment that also required the player to look at the game's packaging to find a new radio frequency.<\/p><h3>Mantis<\/h3><p style=\"\">Metal Gear Solid really did a lot to break the fourth wall so that the player feels more immersed into the warped story-line.<\/p><p style=\"\">This is seen all over the place throughout the game, especially in the <a href=\"\/psycho-mantis\/3005-428\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-428\">Psycho Mantis<\/a> boss fight. The Mantis fight really is a memorable experience as the designers used the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a> hardware in truly innovative ways to freak out gamers. During the beginning of the fight, Mantis will read your Memory Card for certain <a href=\"\/konami-corporation\/3010-87\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami<\/a> games like <a href=\"\/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night\/3030-14216\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night<\/a>, and comment on them.

Put it down as flat as you can.\" Then the controller would vibrate and wiggle around on the floor for a little bit. The fight is filled with a bunch of other little psych-outs, no pun intended, like pretending to change the channel on your TV to <a href=\"\/hideo-kojima\/3040-63395\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\">HIDEO<\/a> 1, and making it impossible to aim at Mantis unless you switch your controller to \"Port 2\" so he can't <a href=\"\/mind-reading\/3015-1391\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1391\">read your mind<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Les Enfants Terribles<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7776\/208886-metal_gear_solid___metal_gear_rex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208886\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7776\/208886-metal_gear_solid___metal_gear_rex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-208886\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/7776\/208886-metal_gear_solid___metal_gear_rex.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">This game has one of the most twisted story-lines of all time, only surpassed by the all-out wackiness of it's sequel. <a href=\"\/liquid-snake\/3005-190\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-190\">Liquid Snake<\/a> and <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake<\/a> were genetically created in a lab from the <a href=\"\/big-boss\/3005-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss<\/a>'s DNA. Big Boss was revered as the perfect soldier back in the day, but he defects and starts to work to destroy the <i>Patriots<\/i>. Liquid and Solid Snake are both products of the <i>Les Enfants Terribles<\/i> project. According to Liquid, Solid Snake received all of Big Boss's dominant genes, and that he got stuck with the recessive genes. The genome soldiers that had been guarding the base had been genetically conditioned, using the research born from Les Enfants Terribles project. Liquid wishes to surpass their father's dream of a world of war, where soldiers can have a purpose.<\/p><h3>Life or Death<\/h3><p style=\"\">Metal Gear Solid has two different endings. The most common ending is that when you have finished <a href=\"\/hand-to-hand-combat\/3015-288\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-288\">fist-fighting<\/a> with liquid on top of the destroyed Metal Gear REX, Snake runs over to <a href=\"\/meryl-silverburgh\/3005-440\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-440\">Meryl<\/a> only to find her dead. Snake says, \"I gave into my fear! I gave into my pain! I sold your life to save my own... I'm a loser. I'm not the hero you thought I was! I'm nothing!!!\" Then <a href=\"\/otacon\/3005-150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-150\">Otacon<\/a> show's up and starts talking about how \"Death is not Defeat\" and stuff. Now Snake's little speech should have raised a red flag. He is referring directly to the <a href=\"\/torture-chamber\/3035-1673\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1673\">torture chamber<\/a> section of the game. If you hit the \"Select\" button during either of the torture sequences, then you are doomed to the \"Hal and Dave\" ending. Surviving <a href=\"\/revolver-ocelot\/3005-346\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-346\">Ocelot<\/a>'s electric shock torture is no joke though, especially on the original PlayStation version (it definitely seems a lot easier on <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-the-twin-snakes\/3030-9594\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9594\">The Twin Snakes<\/a>).<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355635-grabbed_frame_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355635\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355635-grabbed_frame_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355635\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/6550\/355635-grabbed_frame_7.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">First thing's first, you MUST save after fighting <a href=\"\/sniper-wolf\/3005-870\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-870\">Sniper Wolf<\/a> in the hallway. The game will not let you \"Continue\" if you die during this sequence, which means you will have to fight Wolf again. In the <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene<\/a> before the torture, <a href=\"\/revolver-ocelot\/3005-346\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-346\">Ocelot<\/a> will explain that you must push the circle button repeatedly to regain your strength. You cannot use \"AUTO-FIRE\" or the game will not register the button presses. However, my friend and I were able to use a third-party controller with a \"TURBO-FIRE\" button, so if you have a controller that has any kind of \"AUTO-FIRE\" or \"TURBO FIRE\" it might not be a bad idea to give that a try (it will be A LOT easier than the alternative if it works). Okay, there are many techniques for hitting a button really fast. I've heard of people using spoons to slide it across the button or alternating your index and middle fingers to hit the button faster, but I have never been able to use any of these successfully. What I do is hold the controller with my left hand (like you would normally and place my thumb on the D-pad and index finger on the L1 button. I tense up the muscles in my right hand and forearm so that my hand shakes. Then I use my thumb to hit the button while my hand is shaking. Now don't go putting yourself into a seizure or anything, it's not my fault if you hurt yourself, you shouldn't have to tense up your muscles too much anyway. I'm just saying that this is how I beat this section of the game; I'm not saying that it's the right or wrong way. Once you've finished the first round of four progressively longer shocks, you will be sent back to your cell for a brief intermission. Then it's time for round two, which is going to be familiar territory by now. If you succeed, you will be rewarded with the real ending, along with a snazzy new Bandanna for the next play-through which when worn gives you infinite ammo. If you get the other ending you will get the <a href=\"\/stealth-camouflage\/3055-846\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">Stealth Camouflage<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Ghosts<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once you complete a playthrough of Metal Gear Solid, you will be given a digital camera. You can use the camera on your next playthrough to take pictures. You can also see \"ghosts\" of the Metal Gear Solid development team, which are scattered through out the game. Most memorably, you can snap a picture of Hideo Kojima's ghost rising up from the steam of the guard's urine in the men's bathroom of the second base after the M1 Abrams tank battle.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><h3>Bosses<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/revolver-ocelot\/3005-346\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-346\">Revolver Ocelot<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/m1-abrams\/3055-742\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-742\">M1 Abrams<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/gray-fox\/3005-901\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-901\">Gray Fox<\/a> (Cyborg Ninja)<\/li><li><a href=\"\/psycho-mantis\/3005-428\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-428\">Psycho Mantis<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/sniper-wolf\/3005-870\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-870\">Sniper Wolf<\/a> (Communication Towers)<\/li><li>Hind D<\/li><li>Sniper Wolf (Snow Field)<\/li><li><a href=\"\/vulcan-raven\/3005-873\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-873\">Vulcan Raven<\/a><\/li><li>Metal Gear Rex<\/li><li><a href=\"\/liquid-snake\/3005-190\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-190\">Liquid Snake<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h3>Support Team Codec Number<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/colonel-roy-cambell\/3005-839\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Colonel Roy Campbell<\/a> 140.85<\/li><li><a href=\"\/naomi-hunter\/3005-890\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-890\">Naomi Hunter<\/a> 140.85<\/li><li><a href=\"\/mei-ling\/3005-4903\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4903\">Mei Ling<\/a> 140.96<\/li><li><a href=\"\/nastasha-romanenko\/3005-4871\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4871\">Nastasha Romanenko<\/a> 141.52<\/li><li><a href=\"\/master-miller\/3005-5186\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5186\">Master Miller<\/a> 141.80<\/li><li><a href=\"\/meryl-silverburgh\/3005-440\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-440\">Meryl Silverburgh<\/a> 140.15<\/li><li><a href=\"\/otacon\/3005-150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-150\">Hal Emmerich (Otacon)<\/a> 141.12<\/li><\/ul><h2>PlayStation Traits<\/h2><ul><li>1 Player<\/li><li>Memory card 1-15 blocks<\/li><li>Analog controller compatible<\/li><li>Vibration function<\/li><\/ul><h2>Original Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/149200\/2135425-mg02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135425\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/149200\/2135425-mg02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135425\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/14\/149200\/2135425-mg02_copy.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Cover art for the Metal Gear Solid soundtrack<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li><b>1<\/b>.

While the game is mainly played in the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-464\" href=\"\/third-person-perspective\/3015-464\/\">3rd person<\/a>, which is used for exploration and when using <a data-ref-id=\"3015-444\" href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\">melee<\/a> objects, the shooting aspect of the game is done completely in the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-330\" href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\">first person<\/a>.

The player is free to move around in the park and accomplish the objectives in whatever order the player sees fit. There are several dozen cars in the Central Park area which the player may choose to drive around in. Doing so minimizes travel time and provides more opportunities to explore the parts of Central Park. Some objectives can only be reached with the use of a vehicle.<\/p><p style=\"\">Although there are many opportunities to use a vehicle there are only four basic models of cars that reappear through out the park: <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1139\" href=\"\/taxi-cab\/3055-1139\/\">Taxi Cab<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-844\" href=\"\/police-car\/3055-844\/\">Police Cruiser<\/a>, and two civilian model cars. There are other vehicles in the game but only appear when they are specific to a mission objective. Each vehicle has different items in the glove box for Carnby to collect and use to complete his objectives.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/103803-Alone_in_the_Dark-Xbox_360Screenshots18431Inventory.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-103803\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/103803-Alone_in_the_Dark-Xbox_360Screenshots18431Inventory.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-103803\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/103803-Alone_in_the_Dark-Xbox_360Screenshots18431Inventory.JPG\"><\/a><figcaption>Inside Carnby's Jacket<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Alone in the Dark features a unique inventory system, which is tied to Carnby's jacket pockets. On the left side, he is able to hold necessities like tape, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1370\" href=\"\/lighter\/3055-1370\/\">lighter<\/a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-295\" href=\"\/knife\/3055-295\/\">knife<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-362\" href=\"\/bandages\/3055-362\/\">bandages<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-533\" href=\"\/ammo\/3055-533\/\">ammo<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-156\" href=\"\/flashlight\/3055-156\/\">flashlight<\/a> batteries. On the right side, he has space to hold bottles, that could contain several things like gasoline or <a data-ref-id=\"3055-698\" href=\"\/alcoholic-beverages\/3055-698\/\">alcohol<\/a>, medical spray, mosquito repellent, anti-rust spray and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-973\" href=\"\/flare\/3055-973\/\">glow sticks\/flares<\/a>. Carnby keeps his trusty <a data-ref-id=\"3055-59\" href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\">pistol<\/a> and flashlight strapped to his chest through out the game. The inventory system also allows for the combination of several items. Almost every combination one could imagine is possible in the game. For example the player can combine a rag with a alcohol bottle to create a convenient <a data-ref-id=\"3055-75\" href=\"\/molotov-cocktail\/3055-75\/\">Molotov Cocktail<\/a> or combine the lighter and mosquito repellent to create a small and portable <a data-ref-id=\"3055-45\" href=\"\/flamethrower\/3055-45\/\">flamethrower<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1058\/384748-29677_normal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384748\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1058\/384748-29677_normal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-384748\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1058\/384748-29677_normal.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Aerosol Flamethrower<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">A key element of the game is the ability to use fire as a weapon or as a problem solving element. The player is capable of putting wooden objects like chairs or tables up against a flame to create a portable <a data-ref-id=\"3055-484\" href=\"\/torch\/3055-484\/\">torch<\/a> or a weapon to use against demons. Fire is capable of spreading from room to room, and is able to engulf almost every flammable object in the game. The enemies of Alone in the Dark can only be completely be destroyed by using fire, so using fire becomes an essential aspect of the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is also a persistent damage system which is shown on Carnby's character model. The player will notice open wounds on Carnby as well as blood trails and droplets coming from him as he walks. The player must use the medical spray to heal minor wounds and bandage up those which are heavily bleeding. Some enemies in the game are attracted to blood so it is wise to bind all wounds as quickly as possible.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1517287-alone_in_the_dark_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1517287\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1517287-alone_in_the_dark_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1517287\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62890\/1517287-alone_in_the_dark_ost.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>CD Cover Artwork<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-189\" href=\"\/original-soundtrack\/3015-189\/\">original score<\/a> for the game was composed by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-84394\" href=\"\/olivier-deriviere\/3040-84394\/\">Olivier Derivi\u00e8re<\/a>.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><th>Track No.<\/th><th>Title<\/th><th>Running Time<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">01<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Prelude to an End<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>01.33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">02<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Edward Carnby<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>02.36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">03<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>The Fissure<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>03.42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">04<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Collapsing Floors<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>04.34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">05<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>The Fa\u00e7ade<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>04.58<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">06<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Reception Hall<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>04.39<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">07<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>The Humanz<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>04.26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">08<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Who Am I?<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>02.25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">09<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Central Dark<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>01.24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">10<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Crying New York<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>02.36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">11<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Loneliness<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>02.03<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">12<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Bethesda Fight<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>02.02<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">13<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Killing the Fissure<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>03.47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">14<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>No More Humans<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>04.39<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">15<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Truth<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>01.11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">16<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Niaman<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>01.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">17<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>The Light Carrier Test<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>05.51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">18<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>Shto Li (a Cappella)<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>02.20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">19<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>The Final Gate<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>05.08<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">20<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>The Choice<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>01.35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">21<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>An End for a Prelude<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>04.10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\">22<\/div><\/td><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><b>A Solo In the Park<\/b><\/div><\/td><td>03.05<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><ul><li><b>Operating System<\/b>: Windows XP SP2 \/ Windows Vista<\/li><li><b>CPU<\/b>: 2.8 GHz Intel Pentium 4 or Athlon 64 2800<\/li><li><b>Video Card<\/b>: NVidia GeForce 7600 or ATI Radeon X1650 or better<\/li><li><b>RAM<\/b>: 1GB<\/li><li><b>Disk Space<\/b>: 8.5GB<\/li><\/ul><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation<\/h2><ul><li>Alone in the Dark requires 6.5GB of space to install on an <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\">Xbox 360<\/a> HDD.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Inferno: The PlayStation 3 version<\/h2><p style=\"\">In November 2008 (Just several months after the XBOX360 version), <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"\/atari\/3010-182\/\">Atari<\/a> released Alone In The Dark: Inferno for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\">PlayStation 3<\/a>.

Opening in Mr. White's Estate, the story follows that of Quantum of Solace loosely, but also flashes back to events from Casino Royale. Among these events is the famous chase in Madagascar from the start of Casino Royale, where Bond pursues a bomb-maker through a construction site. Other events were created specifically for the game, such as fighting on the roof of the train traveling to Montenegro. This does not appear in the film, and was created entirely for the game. <br\/><\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2>Multiplayer in Quantum of Solace supports 12 players across seven different game modes on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.\u00a0 Over the course of a battle, players earn credits that can be used at an in game store, in real-time (without the need to exit out of the game) to purchase new weapons, items and perks.\u00a0 Similar to Call of Duty 4, players can have five different customizable classes for yourself at anytime, and the basic load-out is the same as well, where you will start out with a primary weapon, pistol, and grenades.<br\/> <br\/>Different multiplayer modes include:<br\/><p style=\"\"><br\/><b>Classic - <\/b>Classic deathmatch mode\u00a0is very similar to the Old-School Deathmatch gametype from Call of Duty 4.\u00a0 Instead of choosing from your preset load-outs, all players start out with a pistol and all other weapons are scattered around the map.<br\/><br\/><b>Conflict\/Team Conflict - <\/b>Essentially a deathmatch mode that allows you to choose from your preset load-outs. Conflict can also be played as a Team Deathmatch mode.<br\/><br\/><b>Territory Control - <\/b>As the name suggests, Territory Control is all about capturing and defending points across the map. <br\/><br\/><b>Bond Versus - <\/b>A randomly selected player is chosen to be Bond and everyone else is assigned to take him out.\u00a0The Bond\u00a0player must either kill all other players or disarm two of three bombs that are placed around the map. In order to make things a bit more balanced, the Bond player is given several advantages like two lives per round, a health boost, a faster run speed than other players, and the ability to see all enemies on his mini-map.<br\/><br\/><b>Bond Evasion - <\/b>Bond Evasion tasks a group of MI6 agents with protecting a randomly selected Bond character as he makes his way to an extraction point. The other team has to take the Bond player out before he reaches the extraction point.<br\/><br\/><b>Golden Gun -<\/b> The Golden Gun mode takes the iconic gold six-shooter from the Bond series and makes it the center of this mode. There are no teams and the only goal is to find the golden gun and kill as many other players with it as possible before you are killed.\u00a0 After the timer runs out, the player with the most points wins.<\/p><br\/> <h2>Levels<\/h2> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>White's Estate<\/li><li>      Siena <\/li><li>      Opera House<\/li><li>      Sink Hole        <\/li><li>      Shanty Town<\/li><li>

The game is set in the same world as <a href=\"\/andrzej-sapkowski\/3040-99940\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99940\">Andrzej Sapkowski's<\/a> short stories. The sequel picks up a couple of months after <a href=\"\/the-witcher\/3030-10473\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10473\">The Witcher's<\/a> ending and contains many returning characters.

The game went \"gold\" on April 27 and was released on May 17, 2011 for PC. It was also released on the same day through CD Projekt's own digital distribution service, <a href=\"\/good-old-games\/3015-2379\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG.com<\/a>, without any <a href=\"\/digital-rights-management\/3015-1704\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1704\">DRM<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">CD Project later confirmed there would be an Xbox 360 release, along with an Enhanced Edition (a free patch updating the original release with fixes made for the console port) for the PC, on April 17, 2012.<\/p><p style=\"\">CD Projekt RED announced during their 2012 Spring Conference that The Witcher 2 sold 1.7 million copies (all versions combined) since it launched.<\/p><h2>Technology<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1450\/1483979-30037the_witcher_2_screenshot_42.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1483979\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1450\/1483979-30037the_witcher_2_screenshot_42.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1483979\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/1450\/1483979-30037the_witcher_2_screenshot_42.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Large environments with no loading screens.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Citing the limitations of the <a href=\"\/aurora-engine\/3015-1468\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1468\">Aurora Engine<\/a> (used in the first game), CD Projekt decided to develop a new engine (named Red Engine) to implement their vision for The Witcher 2.<\/p><p style=\"\">The new engine was built from the ground up to accommodate the branching narrative structure of the game and uses graphical features such as specular lighting and dynamic shadow effects. The Witcher 2 features the same delayed consequences seen in the first game, where player decisions often have far reaching ramifications several hours down the line. The player actions are said to affect every single person within the game world.<\/p><p style=\"\">The new engine renders large, detailed environments with no need for load times, as players can travel from one zone to another seamlessly. The environments often contain clues and trails that players have to follow to solve mysteries and quests. The game world is also more explorable than its predecessor and allows players to scale walls, hop over fences and ascend rock formations. It also features a full <a href=\"\/daynight-cycle\/3015-92\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-92\">day\/night cycle<\/a>.

Through various dialogue choices, he recounts the events that led to his capture; events that players will play through themselves and serve as the game's primary tutorial. Geralt's recollection picks up a few months after the first game's ending, with him in bed with <a href=\"\/triss-merigold\/3005-14601\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14601\">Triss Merigold<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Since Geralt is still suffering from long term amnesia, the story explores more of his violent past through various quests and flashbacks. The story features many returning characters from the first game and the book, many of whom often have their own motivations &amp; emotions and take diverging paths to Geralt. Players can also <a href=\"..\/..\/character-import\/92-970\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">import a save game<\/a> and see how their previous decisions affected these characters and the world. As players make these decisions, Geralt's journal is updated with poetic text as if it was being written by a bard singing his praises.<\/p><p style=\"\">The first game's controversial card collection mini-game centered around <a href=\"\/romance\/3015-253\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-253\">romance<\/a> has been dropped in favor of a more realistic depiction, instead showing fully animated cutscenes with any partner. The dialogue tree has also been changed to illustrate a more dynamic camera, such as the type that <a href=\"\/bioware\/3010-98\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-98\">Bioware<\/a> has begun to use in games like <a href=\"\/mass-effect\/3025-560\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-560\">Mass Effect<\/a> and <a href=\"\/dragon-age-origins\/3030-20738\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20738\">Dragon Age: Origins<\/a>. The dialogue choices are also more integrated in the world (simply floating rather than being on a menu background) to help give a better sense of immersion. Certain dialogue options will only give players a limited time to make a decision.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791497-witcher2__7_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791497\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791497-witcher2__7_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791497\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791497-witcher2__7_.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Roche interrogating Geralt<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As the game begins, Geralt finds himself imprisoned for the assassination of King Foltest of Temeria and suffering from a severe case of amnesia. He is being interrogated by Vernon Roche, the commander of the Blue Stripes (Temeria's Special Forces). Geralt insists he did not kill the king and recounts the events that lead to his death.<\/p><p style=\"\">Geralt's begins his story with Foltest's assault against the La Valettes, a conflict which arose from Foltest's denial of bastard children he fathered with Lady La Valette and the desire of Temeria's noblemen to use his children as a 'banner' to usurp his kingdom. Up to the day of the assault, Geralt had followed Foltest in the campaign for he served as the King's supposed lucky charm, having saved him from a previous attempt on his life. Also accompanying them was the Witcher's lover, Triss Merigold, who served as Foltest's personal advisor and court sorceress.<\/p><p style=\"\">During the attack, the Witcher faces Aryan La Valette, the lady's eldest son, whilst a dragon flys across the keep, decimating both armies. The Witcher eventually delivers King Foltest to where his children are being held, guarded by a blind monk. Given the Witcher's appearance, Foltest asks him to stand aside, lest he frighten his already frazzled children. With Geralt distracted, the monk drops his hood and blindfold (revealing himself to be a heavily muscled Witcher), and cuts the king's throat from ear to ear. The Witcher pursues but the killer escapes out a nearby window and onto a Scoia'tael (Elven guerilla fighters) ship waiting below.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791540-witcher2__50_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791540\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791540-witcher2__50_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791540\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791540-witcher2__50_.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Siege of La Valettes<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When Geralt finishes his tale, Roche is intrigued, but skeptical. However, the two deduce that the Scoia'tael's involvement bears investigation. Ultimately, Roche decides to help with Geralt escape the prison. The Witcher escapes that very night, and together with his Triss, Roche and the rest of the Blue Stripes, sets sail for Flotsam, where an infamous elf named Iorveth and his Scoia'tael were known to operate.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon arriving in the city's outskirts, they immediately encounter Iorveth who attacks and is later seen conversing with the assassin. Geralt, Triss and Roche flee to Flotsam, where Geralt discovers his friends Dandelion the bard and Zoltan Chivay the dwarf, who are about to be hanged. Roche and the Witcher saves them from their fate, thus making his presence known to Flotsam, and particularly its ruler, the so called Commandant Loredo.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Commandant informs the Witcher of the difficulties facing Flotsan, including attacks from the Scoia'tael and the Kayran, a beast that has halted traffic along the river. He tells Geralt that if he deals with the latter, he will have his full support in finding Iorveth. Geralt agrees, then kills the monster with the help of a sorceress named Silla, who came to the outpost to claim the contract for the creature.<\/p><p style=\"\">After defeating the beast, Geralt meets a Scoia'tael lieutenant on a prison barge docked outside town who claims the kingslayer, known as Letho, intends to betray Iorveth. As it turns out, Zoltan was to be hanged for conspiring with the Scoia'tael, because Commandant Loredo was notoriously discriminatory toward non-humans. Thus the dwarf arranges a meeting between Geralt and Iorveth, where the Witcher informs the elf of the kingslayer's intentions. The pair decide to confront Letho, who in turn reveals that he was planning to betray Iorveth. Before the two can capture Letho however, Roche arrives with an armed force. Geralt duels the Kingslayer and is subsequently defeated. However, Letho spares his life, revealing that Geralt once saved the lives of Letho and his own band of witchers. He then kidnaps Triss, forcing her to teleport them to Aedirn.<\/p><p style=\"\">At this point in the story, Geralt can either continue on with Roche or Iorveth.<\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Act 2 - Iorveth's Path<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\">Geralt and Iorveth steal the prison barge docked in Flotsam and set sail for Aedirn. Upon their arrival they stumble upon a meeting between King Henselt of Kaedwen and the rebel army of Prince Stennis (the son of the slain King Demavend), and his commander Saskia the Dragonslayer. A battle breaks out only to be interrupted by an ancient curse, activated when blood spatters on an ancient sculpture. Spectral soldiers, the souls of Henselt's soldiers who died in a horrid battle 3 years earlier, attack the group. Iorveth and Geralt, along with the sorceress Philippa Eilhart (now serving as advisor to Saskia), escort Saskia and Prince Stennis across the ghost field battlefield, returning them safely to Vergen. The rebels hold a meeting where Saskia announces her intentions to lead a rebel army against King Henselt. An army comrpised of Vergen's dwarven forces, Iorveth's Scoia'tel, and Stennis' soldiers. The group rallies behind Saskia, declaring her Queen, but as the meeting concludes she falls ill to a powerful and mysterious poison.<\/p><p style=\"\">Geralt decides to not only track down the ingredients for an antidote, but to gather a series of magical artifacts to lift the curse from the former battlefield.<\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Act 2 - Roche's Path<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\">Roche discovers Commandant Loredo is spying for the Kaeweni and asks Geralt to kill him. Geralt and the Blue Stripes then set sail for Aedirn. Upon their arrival they stumble upon a meeting between King Henselt of Kaedwen and the rebel army of Prince Stennis (the son of the slain King Demavend), and his commander Saskia the Dragonslayer. A battle breaks out only to be interrupted by an ancient curse, activated when blood spatters on an ancient sculpture. Spectral soldiers, the souls of Henselt's soldiers who died in a horrid battle 3 years earlier, attack the group. Geralt and Roche help the group fight off the spectres and with the aide of his two mage advisors, Dethmold and Sile de Tansarville, escort King Henselt across the battlefield. Once the group arrives safely in the Kaeweni camp, Henselt tasks Geralt with not only removing the curse from the battlefield, but one from the king himself. A curse placed on him by another sorceress by the name of Sabrina Glevissig, whom Henselt had burned to death following the battle 3 years earlier.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the meantime, while Geralt continues his search for Triss and the Kingslayer, he uncovers a plot accusing Henselt of conspiring with the Nilfgaardians. He soon discovers that Triss has been taken by Nilfgaardian spies, who have taken her to the ancient elven city of Loc Muine. After the curse is lifted, two witchers by the name of Auckes and Serrit, in league with Letho, attempt to kill King Henselt. Geralt defends the king, killing Auckes in the battle. Dethmold casts a spell allowing Geralt to look into the now deceased Aucke's memories, revealing that the Kingslayers are in league with Sile de Tansarville. Shortly thereafter, Geralt lifts the curse from the battlefield and Henselt marches on Vergen. It is revealed that Roche has been leading the insurgency and Henselt has all his men hung. Roche and Geralt make way for Vergen, hoping to track down Sile and Phillipa Eilhart, who they now know are behind Demevend's death. They miss the pair, who left for Loc Muine, with Saskia as their prisoner. They then confront Henselt, where Geralt kills the king's bodyguard. Geralt then chooses to either let Roche get his revenge by killing Henselt, sparking a civil war, or convince him to spare the king's life.<\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Act 3<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\">Depending on who Geralt assisted in Act 2, he arrives in Loc Muine with either Iorveth or Roche.  Mages from the various kingdoms have convened in the city to discuss the formation of a new magical organization called \"The Conclave.\"  As a result, many of the realms royal leaders are also in the city and Phillipa Eilhart and Sile de Tansarville plan to use the still spellbound Saskia as leverage.  At the same time, Geralt tracks down the Nilfgaardian spies who are holding Triss hostage.  If he arrived with Roche, he finds that Dethmold has kidnapped Princess Anais, Foltest's daughter.  He then must decide to rescue Triss or Anais.  If Geralt sided with Iorveth, he finds that Phillipa has been captured by King Radovid of Redania, who carves her eyes out.  Geralt must then choose to rescue Triss or Philippa, who is the only person who can free Saskia from her trance.<\/p><p style=\"\">If Geralt chooses to save Anais, Roche murders Dethmold out of revenge, and the two can choose to send her to either King Radovid or John Natalis of Temeria. If he rescues Philippa, the Nilfgaardians begin a witch hunt, implicating all the mages, but Saskia establishes a free kingdom in the Pontar Valley.  If the player saves Triss, the Nilfgaardian plot is destroyed with the death of Renauld.  The mages re-establish themselves, and Temeria is dissolved.  Dethmold manages to escape and Roche takes Anais into exile.  During the meeting, Letho arrives with the Nilfgaardian forces in tow and reveals the sorceress' plot.<\/p><p style=\"\">S\u00edle escapes and activates her teleportation device. However, Letho sabotaged the device and it kills her. Geralt can choose to let her die or save her life and allow her to escape. Geralt then battles Saskia in dragon form and ultimately defeats her. If he assisted Saskia and Iorveth and chose to rescue Philippa, he is able to break the spell over Saskia's mind, otherwise he must choose to kill her or let her live on in dragon form.  <\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Epilogue<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><\/ins>Geralt then finally confronts Letho, the kingslayer, who frees Triss if Geralt did not save her. Geralt can choose to talk to Letho or kill him outright.  If he chooses the former, Letho reveals that he is in fact a witcher from the school of the viper in the south, along with Serrit and Auckes. Geralt once saved them and turned over Yennefer of Vengerberg to their care. They eventually made their way into Nilfgaard, where the Emperor, Emhyr var Emreis,  asked them to destabilize the Northern Kingdoms by assassinating kings. In exchange, the Emperor promised to build a new witcher school for them.  After the confrontation, Geralt reunites with Triss and either Iorveth or Roche, and sets off to Nilfgaard to find Yennefer.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1759006-071_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759006\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1759006-071_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759006\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1759006-071_noscale.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The four skill trees.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The combat from the first game has been overhauled and relies on four major skill trees. Each node on the skill tree has two levels, and some can be further upgraded with mutagens found in the game.<\/p><ul><li><b>Training -<\/b> Increases Geralt's general combat and physical capabilities like his stamina and ability to parry or block in combat. Players must invest a minimum of 6 points in this talent tree to unlock the remaining three.<\/li><li><b>Swordmanship -<\/b> Improves Geralt's sword fighting skills and gives him new moves and abilities. Affects both the normal and silver swords the witcher carries.<\/li><li><b>Magic<\/b> - Improves Geralt's knowledge of \"Signs\" (which are essentially magic spells he can cast in combat). There are multiple branches which improve the effectiveness of an existing sign by adding extra damage or special effects like a stun.<\/li><li><b>Alchemy<\/b> - Improves effectiveness of potions, oils and bombs made using alchemy. Some talents allow for use of multiple potions or reduce their side-effects.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The multiple stance and rhythmic timing-based system has been dropped in favor of a more fluid, action-oriented approach, inspired by games like <a href=\"\/batman-arkham-asylum\/3030-23245\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\">Batman: Arkham Asylum<\/a> and powered by the <a href=\"\/havok-physics\/3015-502\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok physics engine<\/a>. Geralt now has two basic attacks: Quick (Left Mouse) and Strong (Right Mouse), that can be strung together to perform various <a href=\"\/combo\/3015-18\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-18\">combos<\/a>. Players can <a href=\"\/block\/3015-1843\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1843\">block<\/a> incoming attacks and with the right timing, execute a <a href=\"\/parrying\/3015-2485\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2485\">parry<\/a> and <a href=\"\/riposte\/3015-4316\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4316\">riposte<\/a> or perform <a href=\"\/dodge\/3015-2476\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\">dodge rolls<\/a>. With good placement, players can trick enemies into causing <a href=\"\/friendly-fire\/3015-2243\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2243\">friendly fire<\/a> damage on each other. The engine features more gory &amp; brutal kill animations.

Geralt can use barrier spells to ward off tougher enemies, telekineses to crowd control and cast offensive spells like fireballs to deal damage. Trap placement has been expanded up to three levels, with increasing benefits based on how many traps Geralt lays down. Players can also slow down time by bringing up a <a href=\"\/radial-menu\/3015-737\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-737\">radial menu<\/a> (by holding down the CTRL key) and change weapons, items and spells on the fly. The game has an optional combat log window that details all the stat calculations going on behind the scenes. One thing players cannot do is drink health giving potions or otherwise heal mid-combat, meaning preparation for big encounters is vital to survival.<\/p><p style=\"\">With the addition of detailed environment, players can use lighting and shadows to <a href=\"..\/..\/stealth\/92-24\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">stealth<\/a> around enemies. The cat potion from the first game has been changed to give Geralt a pseudo-X-ray vision, very much like Batman's <a href=\"..\/..\/detective-mode\/92-6244\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">detective vision<\/a> in Arkham Asylum. Players can also engage in hand-to-hand duels that use <a href=\"..\/..\/quick-time-event\/92-6\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">quick-time events<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are multiple <a href=\"..\/..\/minigames\/92-116\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mini-games<\/a> involving fist-fighting, arm-wrestling, dueling, poetry, gambling etc. The number of delivery quests has been cut down in favor of more exploration and combat focused quests. There are also detective <a href=\"..\/..\/side-quests\/92-338\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">side-quests<\/a> where players have to use environmental hints to track down monsters and solve mysteries. Character customization has been expanded to a great degree and players can change almost every aspect of Geralt's weaponry and clothing. In addition, players can also craft their own weapons or upgrade existing ones, further building upon the importance of collecting ingredients and crafting materials from slain enemies, various containers, and vegetation.<\/p><h3>Alchemy<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4344\/1761666-witcher2_2011_04_16_13_28_09_44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761666\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4344\/1761666-witcher2_2011_04_16_13_28_09_44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761666\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/4344\/1761666-witcher2_2011_04_16_13_28_09_44.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Slaying monsters gives a chance at rarer ingredients.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Alchemy no longer requires stringent environmental conditions like fire and can be used to create potions anywhere. In order to create potions the player must <a href=\"\/meditation\/3015-3910\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3910\">meditate<\/a>, but unlike the previous game brewing no longer takes up game time. Alchemy can be used to create three main items:<\/p><ul><li><b>Potions<\/b> - Liquid compounds that grant temporary powers. They are created by adding herbs and monster body parts to a chemical base, like alcohol. They are also the only alchemy product to have side effects associated with their use. This poisonous side effect is measured in terms of \"Toxicity\".<\/li><li><b>Oils -<\/b> Oils are special chemicals applied to swords and other weapons to increase their damage or effectiveness against certain types of enemies.<\/li><li><b>Bombs -<\/b> Powerful explosives that can be used to stun or outright kill an enemy from a distance. Depending on their type and quality, they can cover considerably large areas.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Geralt starts with the knowledge of some basic alchemy recipes but the rest are learned by shopping in towns, looting corpses or collected as quest rewards. There are 9 natural compounds used in alchemy: Aether, Caelum, Fulgur, Hydragenum, Quebrith, Rebis, Sol, Vermillion and Vitriol. These can be extracted from various sources, like herbs or animal parts.<\/p><h3>Mutagens<\/h3><p style=\"\">Being a Witcher, Geralt is a mutant warrior who can use mutagens to enhance his innate abilities even further. When used, these chemical reagents permanently increase the stats for one of his abilities. These can be looted from dead bodies or created as a by-product from alchemy. They are found in three varieties: Lesser, Basic and Greater; each increasing stats by an ascending amount.<\/p><p style=\"\">Mutagens can be used to gain one of the following effects:<\/p><ul><li><b>Critical Effect<\/b>: Increase Geralt's critical chance in melee combat.<\/li><li><b>Range<\/b>: Increase the range of Signs.<\/li><li><b>Power:<\/b> Increase sword or melee damage<\/li><li><b>Strength<\/b>: Increase damage reduction<\/li><li><b>Concentration<\/b>: Increase damage dealt by Signs.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Enhanced Edition<\/h2><p style=\"\">Released on April 17th 2012 as a free digital update for the PC, as well as a retail release - and included with the Xbox 360 version right from the start - the Enhanced Edition introduced over one hundred enhancements, tweaks, bug fixes and changes to the core game of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, plus hours of new content such as new quests, new locations and new cutscenes.<\/p><p style=\"\">A pre-loader for the PC version was released several days before the initial release of the Enhanced Edition to try to eliminate traffic on day-one since the update has over ten Gigabytes of new files. It was made clear that the directory should not be moved before the game was successfully updated on April 17th.<\/p><h2>Version 2.0<\/h2><p style=\"\">Released the 29th of September 2011, this free patch, brings two new game modes to the Witcher 2: Dark Mode, and an Arena mode; along with various tweaks and enhancements, and a tutorial. All of these will be shipped on-disc for the Xbox 360 release.<\/p><h3>Dark Mode<\/h3><p style=\"\">Dark mode is a new difficulty level designed for people wanting new challenge for their subsequent play-throughs, and it adds an assortment of powerful, new, dark themed items to the game.<\/p><h3>Arena Mode<\/h3><p style=\"\">An arena mode that allows the player to fight waves upon waves of enemies -- of which get progressively stronger and more difficult to defeat -- to achieve the highest score the player can. Leaderboards have been set up so players can strive to have the highest score of any Witcher 2 player. This mode also introduces a new enemy.<\/p><h2>Announcement<\/h2><h3>Promotional Video Leak<\/h3><p style=\"\">On Sept 16, 2009, a video was leaked from <a href=\"\/cd-projekt-red-sp-z-oo\/3010-2890\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2890\">CD Projekt<\/a>'s offices that was intended as promotion to obtain a publisher. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JciyoGmnGyo\" rel=\"nofollow\">In the video<\/a>, it is described that the team has worked hard on improving graphics from the original game, and completely revamping the way the world works.<\/p><h3>Announcement Trailer<\/h3><p style=\"\">In March 2010 an official trailer for the game was released showing that <a href=\"\/atari-inc\/3010-182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari<\/a> would once again be publishing for the developer. The trailer depicted story elements of a large man who specifically targets Kings to assassinate, a man with black hair and an eye patch, and Geralt with a pony tail instead of the hairstyle used in the first game. It can be inferred that Geralt must fight the other two aforementioned men as major antagonists of the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">Thorough fans were able to find a single frame hidden in the trailer with a secret message to dedicated fans about the game from the developer. They promise that the fans will enjoy the sequel as they made it to be very similar to the original, but to creatively enhance and extend the properties of it. They also mention that they feel that claims of PC gaming and PC RPGs being dead are \"unagreeable\" due to the fact that the first Witcher sold 1.5 million copies on PC alone.<\/p><p style=\"\">The text of the hidden message (original smilies included) reads:<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\">This message is for our biggest fans. Analyzing our stuff pixel by pixel. It's good to see you again! :-)<\/p><p style=\"\">BTW: Simple minded people think that nobody is reading these days, dear reader of this, we think that we can agree that is bullshit, huh?<\/p><p style=\"\">Same as the fact that single player RPGs are dead, or PCs?<\/p><p style=\"\">We sold 1.5 million units of the game from a dying genre on a dying platform - so we somehow cannot agree ;-)<\/p><p style=\"\">Before we start talking about TW2 please let us thank you for your great support and appreciation.<\/p><p style=\"\">It always motivates us and make us happy.<\/p><p style=\"\">We started working on TW2 right after release of TW. Our goal was to create all the things which made TW so great even better in TW2.<\/p><p style=\"\">We are very proud of TW but lets be honest, it was our debut. We never made any game before, and we practically learned as we worked.<\/p><p style=\"\">So there were many things which could be done better, you know it as good as us :-)<\/p><p style=\"\">But the vision, the main concept, remains the same: a game with a mature, captivating and non linear story, and full of spectacular combat.<\/p><p style=\"\">A game created by a team of independant thinkers immune to corporate priorities, who don't care what's trendy at the given moment.<\/p><p style=\"\">The core vision of the game hasn't changed. What has changed is the quality and the maturity we can deliver. That's largely because we're more experienced and also due to the fact that we've created our own technology. Do you remember how we made significant improvements with the Aurora Engine in the original game, but it still had its limitations?<\/p><p style=\"\">Now we've created technology designed specifically to create non-linear games with extensive plotlines and a living word...<\/p><p style=\"\">Well, there's no point in expanding on that too much - you have to check out our tech yourselves!<\/p><p style=\"\">Nevertheless, we have many reasons to believe that you will like The Witcher 2!<\/p><p style=\"\">See you soon and stay tuned! :)<\/p><\/blockquote><h3>Xbox360<\/h3><p style=\"\">On 06.02.2011 during a pre E3 conference in Venice Beach CD Projekt team announced the release of an Xbox 360 version by the end of the year.

Point Man is being <a href=\"\/torture\/3015-2574\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2574\" data-mce-href=\"\/torture\/3015-2574\/\">tortured<\/a> on where his command officer, <a href=\"\/jin-sun-kwon\/3005-21512\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21512\" data-mce-href=\"\/jin-sun-kwon\/3005-21512\/\">Jun<\/a>, is. Jun knows top secret information about Alma and the Fairport incident and Armacham want her out of the equation. Paxton Fettel comes to the rescue, telling Point Man that they must go back to Fairport as something big is about to happen. After busting out of the prison and hijacking a helicopter, the two make it to Fairport.<\/p><p style=\"\">A massive red explosion happens, forcing Point Man to make a crash landing. Shortly thereafter, they realize that the Fairport incident has mutated all survivors into mindless freaks. Jun is eventually saved by Point Man. She has gotten her hands on a tape that shows an Armacham soldier, Beckett, who has apparently some kind of power that connects him to Alma like Paxton and Point Man. Armacham plans to get him out of Fairport but the dastardly duo make it that he doesn't.<\/p><p style=\"\">Beckett is in fact some kind of clone fabricated by Armacham to be like Point Man and Fettel. He experiences the same visions as Alma and it is revealed that Alma is in fact pregnant and that the giant explosions that have been occuring throughout the game are in fact convulsions. It's suggested that Jun is killed by the monsters that are unleashed by Alma which are in fact fragments of her imagination, but before she dies she indicates that Alma must not give birth as whatever she gives birth to will be unstoppable. Fettel on the other hand, suggests that it's time for the family to reunite and become Gods.<\/p><p style=\"\">Before the two can go to Alma, they must first defeat the memory of their \"father\"<a href=\"\/harlan-wade\/3005-19401\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19401\" data-mce-href=\"\/harlan-wade\/3005-19401\/\">Harlan Wade<\/a>. More of a sadist than a doctor and even less of a father, he tortured Fettel when he was young, tormenting him while making Point Man feel inadequate. During the entire entire game, the two are chased by some kind of monster Called <a href=\"\/the-creep\/3015-7285\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7285\" data-mce-href=\"\/the-creep\/3015-7285\/\">The Creep<\/a> which is in fact revealed to be the memory of Harlan After defeating the memory, Harlanadmits that he wanted to create Gods but instead created monsters. He then disappears.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game then flashes to Alma giving birth. Her stomach is grossly huge and she's covered in blood. Jun is revealed to be alive and orders Point Man to kill Alma. Fettel once again disagrees, saying that they were always supposed to become Gods and the two can now become Gods. The two begin to fight. At this point, if you have been playing as Pointman, you will get his ending (which is cannon) and if you have been playing as Fettel you will get his. If you have been playing co-op with a friend, the game will compare your scores and the player with the highest score gets his character's ending.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86760\/1822931-490px_baby.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1822931\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86760\/1822931-490px_baby.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1822931\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86760\/1822931-490px_baby.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Baby or Demon?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After being put in a choke hold, Pointman gets free, pulls out his gun and shoots Fettel three times in the forehead. Fettel, telling his brother how foolish he is, disappears. Alma however gives birth. The player does not see what comes out of her stomach, only that it seems to look like a small infant and that Point Man is happy with what he sees. Alma dies during childbirth and Point Man walks away with the <a href=\"\/the-3rd-prototype\/3005-21507\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21507\" data-mce-href=\"\/the-3rd-prototype\/3005-21507\/\">baby<\/a>. The game has an after credits scene where you see Fettel as a child uniting with Alma before killing most of the guards who were guarding his cell.<\/p><h2>Generative Scare System<\/h2><p style=\"\">Unlike previous F.E.A.R. games, in which the scary scenes and events were all predetermined scripted sequences, <i>F.E.A.R.3<\/i> uses a so-called \"Generative Scare System\" that delivers similar jump scares dynamically on-the-fly, randomly placing them throughout the game world so that even after completing the game, players can never be quite sure when something terrifying might happen.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">F.E.A.R. 3 features a wide variety of multiplayer modes that can be played by up to 4 players. The multiplayer consists of a robust class system as well as leaderboards.<\/p><h3>Soul Survivor<\/h3><p style=\"\">In Soul Survivor, the objective is to survive wave after waves of enemies that are commanded by a player who has been corrupted by Alma and turned into a specter, a spirit that can control other enemies' bodies. The rest of the F.E.A.R. squad try to survive. If one of the members is downed and not healed fast enough, the reaper will corrupt him and turn him into a reaper. The winner is the last man standing.<\/p><h3>Soul King<\/h3><p style=\"\">Soul King is a competitive mode where each player starts out as a specter before the map is flooded by enemies. The player must then take control of one of the enemies and kill anything that moves. Each time an enemy is killed, he drops souls that must be collected. The player who's collected the most souls becomes the soul king. The soul king is clearly visible by any player on the map, making him a prime target as whoever kills him gets half of his souls and becomes the new soul king (of course, the player who was the soul king loses half his souls too). The winner is the player who's the soul king when time runs out.<\/p><h3>Fucking Run<\/h3><p style=\"\">Players must run from A to B while getting chased by the fog of death created by Alma. The fog begins chasing you once you've reached a certain point on the map. Players must stick together as they plow through waves of enemies, running from the fog. If a player falls, he must be revived immediately before the fog kills him. If the fog kills one player, it's game over for the 3 others. Players are alerted when the fog is about to kill them (the screen starts going black).<\/p><h3>Contractions<\/h3><p style=\"\">Players must work together in a mode similar to Horde in Gears of War 2. Players are surrounded by Alma's fog of death from which enemies come out of are are forced to mount barricades to protect themselves. One player has access to a mech suit. The mode operates in rounds and the game ends when all players are down.<\/p><h3>Co-op Story<\/h3><p style=\"\"><i>F.E.A.R. 3<\/i> is the first in the franchise to have <a href=\"\/cooperative-play\/3015-108\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\" data-mce-href=\"\/cooperative-play\/3015-108\/\">co-op<\/a>. You can ether play the game single player as the Point Man, or have a Friend join in as Paxton Fettel. Each character has their own unique abilities, allowing the players to use them together for different strategies.Paxton Fettel can not use weapons but instead has psychic powers at his disposal. He can stun enemies, suspend them for the Point Man to shoot, or even possess them and use their weapons to surprise the enemy, <a href=\"\/geist\/3030-20333\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20333\" data-mce-href=\"\/geist\/3030-20333\/\"><i>Geist<\/i><\/a>-style. He also has a special sense that allows him to see alternate paths and hidden ammo and weapon cashes.<\/p><p style=\"\">F.E.AR 3's co-op mode also has competitive elements built into it as both players compete to become the \"favorite son\" by scoring points. Points are earned by killing enemies in different ways and completing one of four types of challenges: Aggression (Example: melee kill 3 enemies from behind), Tactics (Example: 8 kills with one grenade), Psychic (Example: harvest 5 psychic links) and Aptitude (Example: 5 suicide kills).<\/p><h2><b>System Requirements<\/b><\/h2><ul><li><b>OS:<\/b> Windows XP \/ Vista \/ Windows 7<\/li><li><b>Processor:<\/b> AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 5600+<\/li><li><b>Memory:<\/b> 2GB of RAM<\/li><li><b>Hard Disk Space:<\/b> 8GB<\/li><li><b>Video Card:<\/b> nVidia GeForce 8800 GTS \/ ATI Radeon HD 3800 series (or better)<\/li><li><b>Sound Card:<\/b> DirectX compatible<\/li><li><b>DirectX:<\/b> 9 (or higher)<\/li><\/ul><h2>Xbox 360 HD Install<\/h2><p style=\"\">Installing F.E.A.R. 3 on your hard drive takes up 6.1 GB of space.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1817061-box_fear3.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1817061-box_fear3.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1817061-box_fear3.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1817061-box_fear3.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1817061-box_fear3.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1817061-box_fear3.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1817061-box_fear3.png"},"name":"F.E.A.R. 3"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Dark Souls is a dark fantasy action-RPG for the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC developed by <a href=\"\/fromsoftware-inc\/3010-760\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-760\">FromSoftware<\/a>. It is the spiritual successor to one of the company's previous titles, <a href=\"\/demons-souls\/3030-24057\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24057\">Demon's Souls<\/a>.

The Xbox 360 version was not released in Japan. <a href=\"\/namco-bandai-games-inc\/3010-382\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-382\">Namco Bandai<\/a> is the publisher for both versions of the game in Western territories. They released the game in North America on October 4, 2011, and in Europe October 7, 2011. The Asian version of the game with English voice-acting and English and traditional Chinese subtitles was released on October 19th, 2011. In April 2012, a German game magazine preview surfaced, revealing a PC version with new Bosses coming in August of the same year. The Prepare to Die Edition was released worldwide for the PC on August 24th, 2012. The additional content, Artorias of the Abyss, came to consoles as downloadable content on October 23rd, 2012 for North America and a day later for other regions.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game (as with its predecessor) is known primarily for its difficulty, including very high combat lethality and scarce information provided to players. Dark Souls director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, has said that the primary \"concepts behind Dark Souls are 'sense of achievement' and 'surprise of discovery' with difficulty merely being a means to these ends. Players who exercise patience and critical-thinking are rewarded. Dark Souls intentionally does not conform to many established game design conventions, such as maps and designated objectives, contributing to the game's divisive reputation.<\/p><h2>Story &amp; World<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122378\/1975130-seath_the_scaleless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1975130\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122378\/1975130-seath_the_scaleless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1975130\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/12\/122378\/1975130-seath_the_scaleless.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Seath the Scaleless, traitor of dragons.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Long ago the world was a gray, lifeless place covered in fog and dominated by dragons.

Being transported to this area also takes you back in time to when the people of Oolacile still existed (though in a deformed manner). The new content explores the story of <a href=\"\/abysswalker-knight-artorias\/3005-24487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24487\">Knight Artorias<\/a>, the legendary <a href=\"\/the-abyss\/3035-4220\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4220\">Abyss<\/a> walker. This content includes an area that is visibly recognizable as the <a href=\"\/darkroot-basin\/3035-4070\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4070\">darkroot garden<\/a> in its past form.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are 4 additional bosses from the new content, several new non-playable characters, and new weapons, armor, and spells. The new bosses are intended to challenge even the most experienced Dark Souls players. The conclusion of the new content rewrites the history of Knight Artorias, as the player kills the famous knight after being heavily weakened by the Abyss. The player character takes the place of Knight Artorias as the Abysswalker, defeating <a href=\"\/manus-father-of-the-abyss\/3005-24711\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24711\">Manus, Father of the Abyss.<\/a> Additionally, the character will take down one of the few remaining Dragon's in Lordran, <a href=\"\/black-dragon-kalameet\/3005-24497\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24497\">Kalameet<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Dark Souls offers a large, seamless world for players to explore. Compared to Demon's Souls, the game is longer, larger, and features more complex level design, as well as more enemies, spells, and equipment to discover. The various regions of the world are interconnected by many routes, some overt and others hidden, and lacks a fixed hub similar to <a href=\"\/the-nexus\/3035-2211\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2211\">The Nexus<\/a> in Demon's Souls. Players will often find that they can access multiple areas at once, and will have to rely on their own instincts and experience to decide where to go.<\/p><h3>Saving<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32189\/1840460-darksouls86.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1840460\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32189\/1840460-darksouls86.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1840460\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/3\/32189\/1840460-darksouls86.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A character resting at a bonfire.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Dark Souls includes a <a href=\"\/auto-save\/3015-1883\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1883\">continuous save<\/a> system, meaning the game automatically saves itself every few seconds. Players never lose progress due to having to load an earlier saved game, as when the player dies, the game continues on by automatically <a href=\"\/respawn\/3015-989\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-989\">respawning<\/a> the player at the last visited bonfire with death penalties (see below). The game only uses one save slot per character, with no option for the player to save to additional slots, which makes every action the player takes carry the weight of permanence (as there is no \"earlier save\" to reload).<\/p><h3>Dying<\/h3><p style=\"\">Dark Souls uses a kind of \"two strikes and you're out\" system for deaths. When a player dies, the player drops all currently held Humanity and souls, and, if in human form, changes to \"hollowed\" form (see multiplayer below). On the spot where the player died, a bloodstain will appear, containing all of the player's lost humanity and souls. If the player is able to return to that spot and touch their bloodstain without dying again, the player will reclaim all of their lost humanity and souls. However, if the player dies again before touching the bloodstain of their first death, that bloodstain will vanish forever along with all of the humanity and souls it contained, and a new bloodstain will be created containing only the humanity and souls held by the player at the moment of their second death. In this way, the play can have no more than one bloodstain in existence at any one time.<\/p><h3>Multiplayer<\/h3><p style=\"\">By default, Dark Souls is played online at all times. While a player is playing alone, they will encounter indirect traces of other players playing in parallel in their own games. These traces come in three forms:<\/p><ul><li>Messages can be placed on the ground by players to warn, cajole, or even misdirect other players who happen by and see it. These messages can only be constructed out of a fixed selection of words and phrases, which allows for players worldwide playing in any language to see localized versions of any message. Players can also rate up or down the messages of other players, granting another player humanity in the process.<\/li><li>Bloodstains can be seen on the ground that, when interacted with, will produce a ghostly replay of the last 5 seconds of another player's life before they died in that place. By witnessing another player's demise, a player may be able to learn directly from others' mistakes.<\/li><li>Apparitions of other players that appear for a few seconds showing a real-time glimpse of what another player is doing at that very moment.<\/li><\/ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32189\/1840455-darksouls81.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1840455\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32189\/1840455-darksouls81.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1840455\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/3\/32189\/1840455-darksouls81.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Players can also directly impact others' games by summoning other players to engage in cooperative play or by invading another's game to assassinate the host player. All direct multiplayer interaction is governed by level ranges, that vary depending on the type of interaction that occurs (e.g. for cooperative play, only players who are within 10 levels +10% of the host player's soul level can join the host's game).<\/p><p style=\"\">Cooperative summoning requires both the summoner and the summonee(s) to voluntarily initiate the partnership. Players who wish to be summoned can be in either human or hollowed form and must place their summon sign (a white label with their name) on the ground where they think a potential summoner will see it and then wait. A player who wishes to summon others must first be in human form in order to see the placed summon signs of other players and must be in a level in which the main boss is still alive (since the goal of coop is to kill bosses together) and may then interact with a summon sign of their choice to attempt to summon that player. Up to two players may be summoned at one time (making for a 3-player team).<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122378\/1698486-dark_souls_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1698486\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122378\/1698486-dark_souls_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1698486\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/12\/122378\/1698486-dark_souls_4.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Players who are summoned into a host's game are known as phantoms and special rules apply to them. Phantoms cannot use their Estus Flasks, cannot leave the level that the host is in, and cannot interact with NPCs or objects (like doors, fog walls, or levers). When the host uses an Estus Flask, all phantoms are healed by it as well as the host (making the host responsible for healing his helping phantoms). For every enemy that is killed for any reason, the host gets 100% of the souls and all phantoms also get 50% of the souls. If the host and phantoms manage to kill the level boss, the host gets the standard full rewards, the phantoms get 50% of the soul reward and gain one point of humanity before being returned to their own worlds. If a phantom dies for any reason, he returns to his own world, keeping any new souls they earned and does not suffer any death penalty whatsoever. If the host dies, all phantoms are sent back to their own worlds and the host suffers the full death penalty, dropping all humanity and souls into a new bloodstain and reverting to hollowed form, meaning the host cannot summon new phantoms without first spending humanity to reverse hollowing.<\/p><p style=\"\">Invasions are another form of joining a host's game, but without their permission and for the purpose of PvP. To invade another's game, a player must be in human form and standing in the level they wish to invade in, then use a red eye orb item. A target is any player in human form who is within the correct level range of the invader. Level ranges for red eye orb invasions are different from cooperative summoning in that the player being invaded is limited to 10% of the invader's level below, but unlimited above. (For example, a level 50 invader can invade anyone level 45 and above). If these conditions are met, the invading phantom will appear in the host's game, and the host will receive a message warning them that an invader has arrived.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32189\/1840459-darksouls85.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1840459\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32189\/1840459-darksouls85.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1840459\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/3\/32189\/1840459-darksouls85.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Kirk - Knight of Thorns. An NPC invader.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As an invading phantom, special rules apply, similar to being a summoned phantom: the invading phantom may not use Estus Flasks, leave the level, or interact with NPCs. Because the conditions for a host to get invaded are the same as those for a host to be able to summon cooperative phantoms, the host may summon phantoms to help them to fight against the invader. If the invading phantom is killed, they return to their own world still in human form, but their bloodstain will be wherever they were when they joined the other player's world. The host that defeated the invader will receive a number of souls (dependent on the level of their invader), and can also touch the bloodstain left by the invader to receive one point of humanity. If the host dies for any reason while the invading phantom is in their game, the host suffers the standard death penalty and the invader returns to their own world with a bonus of souls and one extra point of humanity.<\/p><p style=\"\">If the invaded player dies and has an item called an Indictment, they can choose to indict the invading player to give them a point of sin, which is recorded in a kind of online leaderboard called The Book of the Guilty. Players recorded in The Book of the Guilty can be targeted for invasions by members of the Blades of the Darkmoon covenant, who use the Blue Eye Orb and Darkmoon Blade Covenant Ring items to invade a host's world as a \"Spirit of Vengeance\". Darkmoon Blade Covenant invasions differ from all other forms of multiplayer, in that a Spirit of Vengeance can invade players who are at a substantially lower level than they are (50 levels +20% of their level lower, instead of 10% lower).<\/p><p style=\"\">Further into the game, it is possible to acquire an item (Red Sign Soapstone) in The Painted World, which allows players to place down a summon sign on the ground to engage in optional PVP combat. Unlike the white sign soapstone, this summon sign gives off a reddish hue to distinguish itself to other players. Should a player accept the duel, a hostile phantom will enter their world to engage in a battle to the death. A maximum of 3 phantoms may be summoned, all of which can attack one-another. If a red phantom dies in a host's world, any other players present will receive souls for their death, but only the host has the opportunity of gaining a humanity point, by touching the bloodstain left behind by the red phantom that was killed. A Red Sign Soapstone can be seen by anyone 10 +10% levels lower than the player who placed the sign, but unlimited above (for example if a level 50 player placed a Red Sign Soapstone, it would be visible to anyone level 35 and above).<\/p><p style=\"\">Another form of optional PVP combat is available for players in the Path of the Dragon covenant. Upon joining the covenant, the player receives a Dragon Eye item. When using the item, a summon sign is placed on the ground that will appear in other player's worlds. When another player interacts with this sign, they will show up in the summoning player's world as an invader. The winner of the duel will receive one Dragon Scale and an amount of souls relative to their opponent's soul level. This Dragon Scale is not taken from the losing player's inventory, there is no penalty at all for losing a duel initiated in this manner. Dragon summon signs appear for players within the normal co-op range of 10 +10% of the summoner's soul level.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players in the Gravelord Servant have the ability to initiate invasions in a different form from the other multiplayer options. If they are human and in an area where they have not yet defeated the boss, they are able to use consumable Eye of Death items to \"infect\" three other player's worlds. Players eligible for this infection are any within a range of 10 +10% of the Gravelord player's level. If the infected player is on their first playthrough of the game this has no effect. However, if the player is on a New Game+, black phantom versions of enemies will appear in addition to the regular enemies in their world. The black phantom versions of enemies deal more damage, and have more health than regular enemies. The Gravelord Servant player's summon sign appears in the infected worlds as well, and in order to remove the black phantom enemies, those players must find the sign and interact with it to invade the Gravelord Servant's world. Upon the death of the Gravelord Servant, or the Gravelord Servant leaving the area or quitting the game, the infected player's worlds are returned to normal.<\/p><h4>Battle of Stoicism<\/h4><p style=\"\">The Artorias of the Abyss DLC also added a battle arena to the game for more direct PVP confrontation. There are three modes of play: 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, and 4 player <a href=\"\/deathmatch\/3015-451\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players will be grouped into 1 of 4 tiers automatically. Soul levels 1-50, 51-100, 101 - 200, and 201+ will all be grouped into matches together.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unlike all other forms of PVP, no souls, humanity, or covenant items can be gained from winning Battle of Stoicism matches. Instead, players are rewarded with a place on an in-game leaderboard called the Plaque of Legends.<\/p><h2>Stats<\/h2><h3>Vitality<\/h3><p style=\"\">Governs the player's maximum health points.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Vitality:<\/b><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>20<\/b><\/td><td><b>30<\/b><\/td><td><b>40<\/b><\/td><td><b>50<\/b><\/td><td><b>60<\/b><\/td><td><b>70<\/b><\/td><td><b>80<\/b><\/td><td><b>90<\/b><\/td><td><b>99<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Maximum Health:<\/b><\/td><td>572<\/td><td>792<\/td><td>1100<\/td><td>1325<\/td><td>1500<\/td><td>1588<\/td><td>1675<\/td><td>1758<\/td><td>1837<\/td><td>1900<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Attunement<\/h3><p style=\"\">Governs item drop-rates and the number of spell slots.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Attunement:<\/b><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>12<\/b><\/td><td><b>14<\/b><\/td><td><b>16<\/b><\/td><td><b>19<\/b><\/td><td><b>23<\/b><\/td><td><b>28<\/b><\/td><td><b>34<\/b><\/td><td><b>41<\/b><\/td><td><b>50<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Spell Slots:<\/b><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Endurance<\/h3><p style=\"\">Governs stamina, maximum equipment burden and resistance to bleeding.<\/p><p style=\"\">Roll and run speed will vary based on the percentage of maximum burden used by equip weight.<\/p><ul><li>Equip weight \u2265 100% of Equip Burden makes rolling and running impossible.<\/li><li>Equip weight \u2265 50% of Equip Burden sets movement speed to slow and disabled rolling.<\/li><li>Equip weight &lt; 50% of Equip Burden sets movement speed to medium and rolling speed to slow.<\/li><li>Equip weight &lt; 25% of Equip Burden sets movement speed and rolling speed to fast.<\/li><\/ul><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Endurance:<\/b><\/td><td><b>10<\/b><\/td><td><b>20<\/b><\/td><td><b>30<\/b><\/td><td><b>40<\/b><\/td><td><b>50<\/b><\/td><td><b>60<\/b><\/td><td><b>70<\/b><\/td><td><b>80<\/b><\/td><td><b>90<\/b><\/td><td><b>99<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Stamina:<\/b><\/td><td>91<\/td><td>110<\/td><td>133<\/td><td>160<\/td><td>184<\/td><td>211<\/td><td>237<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Equip Burden:<\/b><\/td><td>44.0<\/td><td>54.0<\/td><td>64.0<\/td><td>74.0<\/td><td>84.0<\/td><td>94.0<\/td><td>104.0<\/td><td>114.0<\/td><td>124.0<\/td><td>133.0<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Strength<\/h3><p style=\"\">Governs attack power for weapons that scale with strength and decides whether or not the player can properly wield heavier weapons.<\/p><h3>Dexterity<\/h3><p style=\"\">Governs attack power for weapons that scale with Dexterity and increases casting speed for most spells.<\/p><ul><li>Casting speed is only effected by Dexterity in the range of 35-45.

Bonfires cannot be accessed while a player's world is invaded or while enemies are in very close proximity.<\/li><li><b>Level up<\/b> - This is the only way that players can increase their character's soul level. To gain a level, the player must spend souls currently held. Each additional level costs more souls to gain than the last.<\/li><li><b>Reinforce Weapon<\/b> - After obtaining a Weapon Smithbox, players can spend crafting materials and souls to upgrade their weapons in various ways.<\/li><li><b>Reinforce Armor<\/b> - An Armor Smithbox is required to upgrade armor similarly to weapons.<\/li><li><b>Repair<\/b> - With a Repairbox, players can spend souls to repair the durability of their weapons and armor.<\/li><li><b>Attune Magic<\/b> - Once spells have been learned, players can choose which of their known spells they would like to have equipped for usage.<\/li><li><b>Bottomless Box<\/b>- After acquiring it, players can store items in it. There is no limit either to the number of items players can hold in their inventories or the number of items that the Bottomless Box can hold, so using the Box is a strictly organizational choice.<\/li><li><b>Kindle<\/b> - Kindling bonfires increases the maximum number of Estus Flasks that the bonfire will replenish. Each bonfire must be kindled separately. A bonfire can be Kindled to replenish a maximum of 10 Estus Flasks, until the player acquires the Rite of Kindling, which allows the amount of times a Bonfire can be kindled. Kindling requires that the player be in human form and expend one point of held humanity per kindling. Every time a bonfire is Kindled, it increases the number of Estus Flasks replenished by 5, up to a maximum of 20 total.<\/li><li><b>Reverse Hollowing<\/b> - Reverts player from hollowed form back to human form at the cost of one point of humanity.<\/li><li><b>Warp<\/b> - Once the in-game item, the Lordvessel, is acquired, the player can warp from any bonfire to any of several specific bonfires in the world. Each destination bonfire must have already been discovered by the player in order to be able to warp to it.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Certain bonfires are tied to Firekeepers who will provide the service of reinforcing Estus Flasks in exchange for a Firekeeper Soul. If a Firekeeper is killed, its corresponding bonfire is extinguished permanently.<\/p><h2>Magic<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are three types of magic: sorcery, which is powered by the caster's Intelligence stat; miracles, which which are powered by the caster's Faith stat; and pyromancy, which is powered only by the strength of the casting implement. Each class of spells has a corresponding casting implement that is required to cast any of those spells: sorcery spells require an equipped catalyst, miracles require require a talisman, and pyromancy requires a Pyromancy Flame. Every spell and miracle has a certain number of uses before it can no longer be used without replenishing it at a bonfire. Each sorcery and miracle also has a minimum stat requirement that must be met in order for a character to learn that spell. Spells can be acquired in the same ways that items can: finding them, being given them, buying them, or starting out with them.<\/p><h2>Covenants<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are nine covenants the player can join, each associated with different characters and factions in the game. Honouring the rules of a covenant will lead to the acquisition of various rewards, while breaking its rules will lead to hostility from that covenant's members as well as other penalties.<\/p><h3>Way of the White<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122378\/1974282-way_of_the_white_logo_large.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1974282\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122378\/1974282-way_of_the_white_logo_large.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1974282\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/12\/122378\/1974282-way_of_the_white_logo_large.png\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">One can enter this covenant by speaking to Petrus of Thorolund, or Reah when she is in the Undead Parish church.

One of the rewards for honouring this pact is a ring that renders the wearer transparent, making him harder to detect. One breaks the pact by killing any creature of the forest.

Players have full control over the character's movement, and using the on-screen reticule, can interact with and use objects. Players will have to search through shelves, cars, and other objects to survive and help other people.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game focuses on interactions with other human characters through <a href=\"..\/..\/dialogue-trees\/92-77\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dialogue trees<\/a>, often with limited time to make a choice. Characters will remember things that players have said before and will often notice discrepancies in the player's dialogue. These interactions can also affect where the story progresses as well.<\/p><p style=\"\">Combat isn't a priority in the game, and is handled similarly to the rest of the gameplay, only more urgent and time-based. Players will find themselves needing to use items that they've gathered throughout the game to chop down zombies or load guns with bullet shells they've found laying around. Choices that players have made previously can also affect how players fight against zombies, such as possessing different equipment or having other characters' assistance.<\/p><h2>Downloadable Content<\/h2><p style=\"\">A downloadable expansion to the game titled 400 Days was released on July 2nd 2013 on PSN and July 3rd on PC and XBLM. This episode is set during the first 400 days of the apocalypse; it will focus on five new characters, and is not directly tied into the storyline of the main game. In order to play the DLC, players will require at least the first episode of Season One. Choices from Season 1 will be carried over from 400 Days and then into Season Two. At least one of the familiar faces from Season One can be found in this 5-part episode. Each part can be played in any order preferred - the timelines will ultimately intertwine.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p style=\"\">Due to the game being separated into episodes, this section will cover the main characters, who have appeared in more than one episode.

The series also set the precedent in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-644\" href=\"\/lucasarts\/3010-644\/\" slug=\"lucasarts\">Lucasarts<\/a> adventures of never allowing the player to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-725\" href=\"\/death\/3015-725\/\" slug=\"death\">die<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Just before the game was set to ship, the company responsible for boxing the games and shipping to retailers told Lucasarts that they could not fill the order in time due to need to give their workers time off. This prompted nearly all of the Lucasarts staff to, themselves, box and ship all of the initial copies of The Secret of Monkey Island. Gilbert has said that during this time he, Grossman and Schafer each signed a one dollar bill and slipped it into one of the boxes. It's unknown if anyone ever found it.<\/p><h2>Insult Sword Fighting<\/h2><p style=\"\">When sword fighting, it's not enough to have the right technique, you must also be able to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2485\" href=\"\/parrying\/3015-2485\/\" slug=\"parrying\">parry<\/a> an opponent's insults with appropriately witty responses. For example; the correct response to \"You fight like a dairy farmer!\" would be \"How appropriate, you fight like a cow!\". If the fighter responds with the correct come back, he earns the right to dish out the next insult. The first to three insults wins the fight.<\/p><h2>In-Jokes<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Secret of Monkey Island is filled with references to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10927\" href=\"\/loom\/3030-10927\/\" slug=\"loom\">Loom<\/a>, another Lucasarts game released around the same time. Early in the game Guybrush encounters Cobb, a character from Loom who wears an \"Ask me about Loom\" button, who's only response to Guybush's attempts at conversation are \"Aye\". That is, however, until Guybrush asks him about Loom. Cobb then launches into full advertisement on the games excellent story and wonderful soundtrack. Other references to Loom include a seagull from them game and the line \"I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?\" after Guybrush is fired from a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-663\" href=\"\/man-cannon\/3055-663\/\" slug=\"man-cannon\">cannon<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game also takes a shot at fellow developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1030\" href=\"\/sierra-entertainment-inc\/3010-1030\/\" slug=\"sierra-entertainment-inc\">Sierra<\/a>. At one point in the game the player can make Guybrush fall off a <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2102\" href=\"\/mountains\/3035-2102\/\" slug=\"mountains\">mountain<\/a> resulting in a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-372\" href=\"\/game-over\/3015-372\/\" slug=\"game-over\">game over<\/a> screen similar to those found in Sierra's adventure games that says \"Oh, no! You've really screwed up this time! Guess you'll have to start over! Hope you saved the game!\". After a few moments Guybrush flys back up the mountain and the game continues as normal.<\/p><h2>Easter Eggs<\/h2><p style=\"\">When the ' <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6920\" href=\"\/important-looking-pirates\/3005-6920\/\" slug=\"important-looking-pirates\">Important Looking Pirates<\/a>' in the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-385\" href=\"\/scumm-bar\/3035-385\/\" slug=\"scumm-bar\">Scumm Bar<\/a> ask Guybrush if he has any special skills, one dialogue option is to tell them that he can hold his breath for 10 minutes.

A squad-based RPG where the goal is for players to create teams of four superheroes from the initial roster of characters and complete various missions which in turn can unlock more characters for players to use. Each character also has four alternative costumes to be unlocked which grant bonuses to their performance. Bonuses are also granted if players create one of the superhero teams from the comics such as the Fantastic Four. Each character brings unique abilities to a players party and experience points gained from combat can be used to upgrade the abilities of selected heroes. Players can change who they want in their party throughout the game allowing them to use unlocked characters without needing to start a new game to use them.<\/p><p style=\"\">The basic premise of Marvel Ultimate Alliance is to stop the evil mastermind Dr. Doom and the group of supervillains known as the Masters of Evil from taking over the world and players will find themselves aiding high-profile superheroes and visiting familiar locations such as <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2351\" href=\"\/stark-tower\/3035-2351\/\">Stark Tower<\/a> and the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier along the way. Players will find they receive an alternate ending based on decisions they make during the game. On top of the already mentioned unlockable characters and costumes, players can also access bonus material such as artwork and extra missions that don't relate to the main story of the game.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><p style=\"\">Marvel Ultimate Alliance has a number of characters for players to form a group with at the start of the game, with many more that can be unlocked by playing through it.

The player begins the game in the form of a microscopic organism that arrives on a planet via exogenesis or panspermia, deposited in the primordial oceans by a meteorite impact. From this point on, the player has the ability to change the physical shape of the creature, giving it different evolutionary traits depending on what path the player wants his life form to take. Eventually, the creature evolves to the point of sentience, and a new gameplay mode begins in which the species establishes its own civilization. Cities are built, technology is researched, and eventually the player's species becomes capable of space flight; the player is able to first explore and colonize their home solar system and later, the entire galaxy. Will Wright has stated that the game's overall goal is to get to the center of the galaxy, and that the game does, in fact, have an ending. While there is no hard ending that acts as an end to gameplay, the final space section culminates in a one-off meeting at the galactic core where you are rewarded with the terraforming staff of life item.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">EA is already planning Spore not just as a game but an entire franchise.

Additionally, EA has announced an iTunes-style \"Spore Store\" which will be built into the game itself, allowing for the digital distribution of future Spore expansion packs as well as Internet sales of Spore merchandise including t-shirts, posters, a collectible card game, and possibly custom figures created from 3D prints of submitted creature designs.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"\/spore-creatures\/3030-21060\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21060\">Spore Creature<\/a> is the Nintendo DS version of spore, featuring different gameplay and overall design based more on story and adventure gameplay, the Nintendo DS version of Spore also featured a unique cartoony style.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The gameplay of Spore takes place on a massive scale, and as such, the game generates many of its assets through procedural programming and system inter-connectivity. The majority of Spore's content is generated both by the game itself, by the player in his own game, and by other players. Spore is being referred to as a \"massively single-player\" game, in which the procedurally generated content (animals, sentient species, planets, vehicles, civilizations, and so on) of each copy of the game are spread to every other copy of the game on the planet, as long as that person's computer is connected to the Internet. Spore's gameplay is comprised of five individual phases, each based on a previously released franchise and genre.

Each editor has a built in complexity limit to prevent the overpowering of vehicles or creatures. However, this may be easily overridden by a console command.<\/p><h2>Game Stages<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game consists of five stages in which you will play through using various play styles while following the life cycle of your creature and the galaxy that they are in.<\/p><h3>Cellular<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376838-201128_5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376838\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376838-201128_5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376838\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/438\/376838-201128_5_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Cell Phase<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After a cinematic opening of a meteorite crashing into a planet, the player begins his creature's journey as a microscopic cell, or microbe. During this stage, using the control of the mouse, you must survive by eating smaller microbes and avoiding larger ones, similar to gameplay in Pac-Man or <a href=\"\/flow\/3030-15849\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15849\">flOw<\/a>. After you have eaten enough, the microbe will lay an egg, allowing you to enter the first editor. In the Microbe Editor, you edit your cell with various parts including weapons, eyes, appendages, etc. These will aid you in survival and also grow your creature. After you leave the editor, your cell enlarges and the camera zooms out, allowing you to see even larger and more versatile microbes. After eating enough food, you progress into the Creature Stage.<\/p><h3>Creature<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376826-196308_3_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376826\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376826-196308_3_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376826\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/438\/376826-196308_3_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Creature Phase<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Upon finishing the Cellular Stage, you will begin constructing your creature that will become your official species throughout the rest of the game. The Creature Editor (along with the other editors) will function the same way as the Microbe Editor, however will allow you to create a sentient, land fairing creature using arms, legs, eyes, mouths, etc. You will then need to carry out tasks such as eating, communicating, and eventually mating. You will encounter many other forms of creatures, both predator, prey, and your own species, and you basically play in a third person free roam. By doing so you will earn DNA points for the editor and evolve your brain, which is required to move onto further stages. After visiting the editor multiple times and meeting the requirements for brain level, mating with another creature of your species will allow you to advance to the Tribal Stage.<\/p><h3>Tribal<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376822-188689_30_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376822\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376822-188689_30_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376822\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/438\/376822-188689_30_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A village during Tribal Phase<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After mating, your creature becomes sentient, which means it is intelligent enough to communicate and hold relations with other creatures. The gameplay style now switches to somewhat of an RTS; you can now control multiple creatures of the same species. The goal of this stage is to grow your tribe to fifteen members or conquer\/ally with five other tribes on the planet (no matter what the species) by way of violence, diplomacy, or religion. Each tribe has a hut, which acts as a base of operations and can have many things added for the tribe members, such as for entertainment and weaponry, however at the cost of food. Your tribe also has 2 special abilities based on how you played creature, for example a omnivore type creature in tribal will be able to summon all creatures around it at the moment to help in combat and will be able to cause a giant sea monster to knock fish out of the water for free food.<\/p><h3>Civilization<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376840-201128_7_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376840\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/438\/376840-201128_7_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376840\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/438\/376840-201128_7_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A city under attack in the Civilization Phase<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When the Tribal Stage is complete your creatures move on to build a city. Gameplay still acts as a RTS, however also adds in the need to maintain your own city, such as Sim City. Once again the goal is dominate the other cities around the planet, however with the addition of having to collect gas from geysers spread across the planet and keeping your enemies away. Cities are obtained in one of three ways. The first two involve building military or Religious units and sending them at a city. If victorious it will be conquered or converted respectively. Both of these methods likely will start a war. The third way is a peaceful method is building Economic units and sending them to open a trade route, leading to you eventually making an offer to buy the city.<\/p><h3>Space<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1073\/822156-spore_2008_11_25_16_48_36.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822156\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1073\/822156-spore_2008_11_25_16_48_36.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-822156\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1073\/822156-spore_2008_11_25_16_48_36.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Exploration of the Final Frontier dominates the Space Phase<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The final stage of the game allows you to construct a spacecraft, which grants you many abilities to help you explore and possibly conquer the galaxy. Hundreds and hundreds of solar systems are available to be explored, and with the use of the many tools that your spacecraft will gain you will be able to manipulate planets, scan for intelligent life, interbreed creatures, and even obliterate a planet entirely, which in turn may cause a new asteroid belt to form. During your encounters with other intelligent species, you may choose to once again settle things peacefully or start an intergalactic war.<\/p><h2>Sporepedia<\/h2><ul><li>Spore has a feature called the Sporepedia, the Sporepedia allows you to browse and download any other player in the worlds creatures,vehicles and buildings.<\/li><li>Players can also create Sporecasts, which are constantly updating packages of creatures by a user.<\/li><li>Players also have a friends system in the Sporepedia and can have their creations featured on the main page.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Controversy<\/h2><h3>SecuRom DRM<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">EA has limited each copy of Spore to five individual installs by the user at any given time; Also the game will re-authenticate any time you add new downloaded content from the Sporepedia. If the user surpasses the five install limit they will receive an error message that will ask the user to verify the registration code and to reinstall the game. Any further issues may be forwarded to EA's support service.<\/p><h3>Piracy<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ironically despite the heavy restrictions put on Spore to prevent piracy it Spore turned out to be the most pirated game of 2008 with over 1,700,000 downloads between its release in September and the lists creation in early December by <a href=\"http:\/\/torrentfreak.com\/top-10-most-pirated-games-of-2008-081204\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TorrentFreak<\/a>. Spore also earned the title of being one of the fastest pirated games of 2008 with over half a million people downloading the game within 10 days of its general release. This is no doubt aided by the fact that Spore was available on torrent websites almost a week before it's official release date.<\/p><h3>Religion in Spore<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In an interview with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/article.php?article_id=211296\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eurogamer<\/a> posted August 11, 2008, Will Wright claimed that most of the \"religiously\" oriented criticism of the game has come from what Wright called \"Militant Atheists\", instead of the expected religious audience.<\/p><h3>AntiSpore.com<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A newly launched website called AntiSpore.com which claims Spore is teaching kids evolution. Also the website claims to want the E rating pulled and made into a M Rated game. The website was later revealed to be a hoax following <a href=\"http:\/\/antispore.com\/2008\/09\/11\/understand-my-beliefs-please\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">references<\/a> to the often implausible nature of content posted on the internet and Poe's Law.<\/p><h2>Graphics Problems<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Spore does not support anti-aliasing and is limited to 30 frames per second at all times. Also, by not being displayed at the standard LCD monitor refresh rates of 60 fps, you will notice screen tearing, which can be very distracting during the later parts of the game. Unfortunately, there is currently no patch to fix these issues. Graphics driver software, however, such as Nvidia forceware, can be used to enable anti-aliasing, texture filtering, and vertical sync.<\/p><h2>Limited Edition<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/16355\/609204-large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-609204\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/16355\/609204-large.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-609204\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/16355\/609204-large.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Galactic Edition<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Spore's limited edition is called \"Galactic Edition\" and will include the following bonus content:<\/p><ul><li>The Making of Spore DVD<\/li><li>How To Make a Better Being DVD (a 50 minutes documentary by National Geographic Channel)<\/li><li>The Art of Spore (a 128-page hardback book with Spore artwork)<\/li><li>100-page Galactic Handbook<\/li><li>Spore poster<\/li><li>Exclusive packaging<\/li><\/ul><h2>Expansions and Patches<\/h2><h3>Creepy and Cute<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"\/spore-creepy-and-cute\/3030-24298\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24298\">Creepy and Cute<\/a> expansion pack adds 60 new creature parts to the editor, 24 new preview animations, 2 new test drive backgrounds and 48 new paint scripts (split evenly into base, coat and detail layers and 12 complete styles).<\/p><h3>Spore Galactic Adventures<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Spore Galactic Adventures was released in June 2009, It included a mission creator and allowed players to beam their creations down to planets and complete missions with them.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Using the Mission creator players can effectively create their own games filled with any creations from the Sporepedia.<\/p><h2>Achievements<\/h2><p style=\"\">Spore Also features almost 100 unlockable achievements<\/p><ol><li><b>Galactic God<\/b> - In one continuous game, evolve a creature from cell to space travel<\/li><li><b>Photographer<\/b> - Send a video or photo to a friend while in Test Drive mode<\/li><li><b>Architect<\/b> - Create 50 buildings and share them<\/li><li><b>Automotive<\/b> Engineer - Create and upload 50 vehicles<\/li><li><b>Biologist<\/b> - Creature and upload 100 creatures<\/li><li><b>Spore Fan<\/b> - Play 50 hours in your Spore galaxy<\/li><li><b>Spore Addict<\/b> - Play 100 hours in your Spore galaxy<\/li><li><b>Creator<\/b> - Play 50 hours in the creator tools<\/li><li><b>Universe in a Box<\/b> - Play through each stage, and use each creator<\/li><li><b>Deja Vu<\/b> - While exploring the universe, come across something you have created<\/li><li><b>Social Engineer<\/b> - Make 5 Sporecastes of 50 assets<\/li><li><b>Rising Star<\/b> - 5 Sporecasts must be subscribed to be 10 people<\/li><li><b>Front Page News<\/b> - One of your creatures or Sporecasts must be featured on Spore.com<\/li><li><b>Creature Stage Unlocked<\/b> - Unlock creature stage<\/li><li><b>Tribe Stage Unlocked<\/b> - Unlock Tribe stage<\/li><li><b>Civilization Stage Unlocked<\/b> - Unlock Civilization stage<\/li><li><b>Space Stage Unlocked<\/b> - Unlock Space stage<\/li><li><b>Aluminum Cell<\/b> - Beat Cell stage on hard<\/li><li><b>Landfall<\/b> - Beat Cell stage, enter Creature stage<\/li><li><b>Pacifist<\/b> - Beat Cell stage with zero kills<\/li><li><b>Completist<\/b> - Unlock every Cell part<\/li><li><b>Speed Freak<\/b> - Beat Cell stage in less than 8 minutes<\/li><li><b>Cell Addict<\/b> - Beat Cell stage 25 times<\/li><li><b>Iron Creature<\/b> - Beat Creature stage on hard<\/li><li><b>Evolver<\/b> - Beat Creature stage<\/li><li><b>Everyone's<\/b> <b>BFF<\/b> - Beat Creature stage by making friends with 20 species<\/li><li><b>Foe<\/b> - Wipe out 20 species<\/li><li><b>Max Power<\/b> - Creature must have maximum stats in 4 abilities<\/li><li><b>Survivor<\/b> - Beat Creature stage without dying<\/li><li><b>Socialite<\/b> - Meet 200 creatures created by others<\/li><li><b>Flight of the Bumblebee<\/b> - Fly for 200 meters;

While Lords of Shadow is a new entry into the <a href=\"\/castlevania\/3025-86\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-86\">Castlevania franchise<\/a>, it is not a continuation of past events from the series. Lords of Shadow is considered by its developers to be a <a href=\"\/franchise-reboot\/3015-4151\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4151\">reboot<\/a> of the franchise. The Belmont history is no more, and new secrets and revelations are made throughout the game that rewrites the mythology of the franchise.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1409518-5_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409518\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1409518-5_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409518\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/669\/1409518-5_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_019.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Tormented<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game starts off with Gabriel arriving in a small village. He helps the villagers fend off an attack from <a href=\"\/werewolves\/3015-543\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-543\">werewolves<\/a>. He then enters a forbidden forest. He seeks <a href=\"\/pan\/3005-16294\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16294\">Pan<\/a>, a spirit of the forest. As Gabriel's amulet leads the way, he's tormented by dreams of his deceased wife, killed by the evil creatures that are invading the world. On his way to finding Pan, to access the Lake of Oblivion, he runs into trouble with some goblins. Pan appears as a horse and helps Gabriel before disappearing.<\/p><p style=\"\">After going through the rest of the forest, shifting through a deadly bog and solving a door puzzle, Belmont finally meets Pan in guardian form. Belmont tells the spirit that he's been sent by The Order of Light regarding the whole demon problem. The player discovers that the world has been cut off from the heavens. Basically, God can't communicate and enact his will on Earth anymore. Gabriel asks Pan if all hope is lost and of course Pan answers in riddles. Because the connection to God doesn't exist anymore, all the dead are trapped. The only way to communicate with them is at the Lake of Oblivion and Pan holds the key. The only way Pan will let our hero pass is if he solves a puzzle. The player must move circular platforms to make a bridge so he can walk up to his wife. Every time a platform is moved, a giant pendulum blade that swings over Marie gets lower. Gabriel succeeds but wakes up from the hallucination and walks through the gates to the lake.<\/p><p style=\"\">Arriving on the frozen lake, Gabriel fights a giant ice golem. Just when the golem is about to get the upper hand <a href=\"\/zobek\/3005-14647\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14647\">Zobek<\/a> arrives and saves Belmont, much to his chagrin as his kill is stolen at the last moment. Zobek too is with the Order and is friends with Pan, which is why he is here. Hundreds of lost souls wander around the lake and Gabriel manages to talk to Marie. She is being used by the Elders of the Order to communicate a prophecy to Belmont. This means that God is speaking through Marie and that there is still hope. What Belmont and Zobek must do is defeat all the Lords of Shadow to assemble the God Mask so Belmont can become the most powerful warrior on earth, the incarnation of God, and rid the world of evil.<\/p><p style=\"\">Belmont and Zobek part ways and Belmont heads towards the lost city of Agaratha where the first Lord is said to be found. After traveling through a maze, Belmont makes it to the ruins only to have a near death experience with a golem. Suddenly, a young girl appears and breaks a crystal. Out of the crystal comes a giant, naked, half-woman half-demon monster that obliterates the golem. Before Gabriel can ask who she is, she escapes and he gives chase. He ends up following her into underground caves. After exploring the caves, Gabriel is almost killed by a giant black knight, before the young girl once again shows up and stops the knight from doing anything. It's revealed that the young girl's name is Claudia. She is mute but can speak into people's thoughts and read them, communicating with Belmont.<\/p><p style=\"\">Claudia is actually the last surviving Aghartian. She used to live a peaceful life many years ago in Aghartha until the Lycans attacked the city. The Aghartians were peaceful beings who had created crystals that were so powerful that nobody ever risked attacking them. They used these crystals to build giant titans that protected them. The war against the Lycans lasted centuries until there were no more crystals. All the Aghartians were killed and those captured were turned into monsters. The <a href=\"\/titan\/3015-2302\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2302\">titans<\/a> kept fighting but were eventually destroyed too, leaving the city in ruin. Among the people murdered were Claudia's father. Before he died he created the Black Knight, the girl's guardian who feeds on darkness and possesses her father's personality. The crystals have now become known as dark crystals and can be used to deliver considerable damage onto the enemy.<\/p><p style=\"\">After reading Belmont's thoughts, Claudia decides that she and the Black Knight will help him in his struggle to defeat the Lords of Shadow.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1471654-952493_20100819_screen008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471654\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1471654-952493_20100819_screen008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471654\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/976\/1471654-952493_20100819_screen008.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Last Titan<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">However, before fighting the evil lord, Gabriel will first have to kill the last surviving Titan(but the sketeton dragon is referred to as a titan and is re-animated near to the end). The Last Titan is huge, much bigger than the ice golem. Thanks to the help of the Black Knight, who cuts part of the Titan's leg off, and Claudia who gives a crystal to Gabriel, our hero kills the final Titan by stabbing it in the face with the crystal. After this long and epic fight, the three decide to go and rest.<\/p><p style=\"\">While resting, Gabriel has a weird dream where he wakes up Claudia, who tells him that she's seen her fate, just before Gabriel stabs her to death. When we see Gabriel's face, weird silver marks are spread across it. Note that this also happened during his vision of Marie at the Lake of Oblivion. Gabriel wakes up to find Pan standing in front of him, telling him that he must do what he must do and to take the Black Knight's gauntlet. Said gauntlet is extremely powerful and would help Gabriel in his quest. Belmont refuses, telling the spirit that he doesn't wish to betray Claudia. Pan replies that he already has. In horror, Gabriel discovers a dead Claudia, with a dagger, Gabriel's dagger, sticking out of her chest. The Knight appears and Belmont is forced to fight and defeat him. He takes the Gauntlet, buries Claudia and soldiers on.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel arrives at the entrance of the first Lord's hiding place. The door is unlocked by fairies and he's able to reach the first Lord, <a href=\"\/cornell\/3005-8531\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8531\">Cornell<\/a>, ruler of the Lycans. Gabriel claims that he must kill Cornell to fulfill the prophecy. The Lord tells Belmont that he is being deceived. He goes on to explain how the Brotherhood of Light came to be (the order Gabriel belongs to). Three founders helped God's fight against the devil and won. They were then lead to three spots where God's influence was extremely powerful. There they sacrificed themselves, turning into powerful spirits, their power only second to God's. However, they left their dark side on earth, these dark sides that were reincarnated into the Lords of Shadow. This means that if Gabriel were to kill a Lord, then the good spirit would die too. Gabriel refuses to believe this and begins to fight Cornell.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1404701-952493_20100615_screen011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404701\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1404701-952493_20100615_screen011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404701\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/976\/1404701-952493_20100615_screen011.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Cornell<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Despite Cornell's giant war hammer and the fact that he turns into a very big werewolf, Belmont comes out on top. Gabriel takes his hammer from him, bashes him over the head a couple times, then when the hammer breaks, he takes its handle puts it through Cornell's face. Right after defeating the Lord, Cornell's cyclone boots attach to Gabriel's feet, letting him run faster. A piece of the God Mask falls from the sky and Gabriel takes it. He also witnesses a brief vision of Marie who caresses his cheek and tells him that he's doing good.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel encounters Pan in eagle form who offers to bring him to his next destination. So starts an epic montage of Gabriel flying an eagle across many lands. They land at the entrance of Crows' Pass. Pan once again can go no farther and when Belmont asks the spirit why he's helping him, Pan simply responds that he is not, and that not everything is what it seems. Crows' Pass is the entrance to vampire territory where the next piece of the God Mask can be found. The Pass is guarded by a once sexy witch who goes by the name of <a href=\"\/malphas\/3005-17651\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17651\">Malphas<\/a>. The witch must be defeated in order for Gabriel to continue on his quest.<\/p><p style=\"\">After fighting a giant ogre (Belmont blinds the beast before slitting its throat with a piece of the environment) and playing hide and seek with a <a href=\"\/chupacabra\/3015-6263\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6263\">chupacabra<\/a> (a mystical midget that steals all of Gabriel's powers and taunts Gabriel while he searches for the midget), Belmont climbs to the tallest tower and confronts the witch. The witch is actually a giant crow with a skull for a head (the Crow Witch). She controls the local crows and lays eggs. Belmont defeats her by throwing an egg back to her face, grabbing onto her and slamming her face first into the tower before decapitating her.<\/p><p style=\"\">After her death, the tower begins to collapse and once again Pan appears, this time as a horse, and saves the day. Belmont is dropped off into the Berros Woods and after fighting his way through the woods, comes to a clearing where he can see from afar the massive castle of the vampires. He enters the small village near the castle and discovers Zobek praying near a pile of dead soldiers. It's revealed that Zobek has been following Gabriel since the beginning of the game but Belmont does not know this. Zobek explains that the vampires know they're coming and are getting ready for a fight. He explains that the small village has been safe from any vampire attacks thanks to an abbot who wields a weapon that reproduces the light of the sun. However, the abbot has gone slightly mad, locking himself in his abbey and booby-trapping the whole place. Zobek recommends getting this weapon as it will aid in the fight against the vampires.<\/p><p style=\"\">Zobek and Gabriel make their way into the abbey and must solve a variety of puzzles and traps, including the classic ceiling trap where<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1471663-952493_20100819_screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471663\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1471663-952493_20100819_screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471663\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/976\/1471663-952493_20100819_screen017.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Zobek<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">different slabs of rock descend from the ceiling and our two heroes are forced to make haste. Gabriel finds a stake that he attaches to the bottom of his cross. The abbey's underground is also where your first encounter with vampires occurs. Gabriel and Zobek eventually end up getting separated (Zobek falls into a trap) and Gabriel is forced to climb alone to the tallest tower of the abbey where the abbot is hidden.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel meets up with Zobek and both go to confront the abbot, gone mad and muttering weird prayers. Belmont tells him that he's not worthy of being a man of God since he let most of the people in the village die because of the vampires. Despite the mad man's pleas, Belmont takes the relic and leaves with Zobek. The abbot starts cursing them, telling them that they were sent by Satan and that they must die. Suddenly vampires appear in the tower and make a feast out of the abbot.<\/p><p style=\"\">As our two heroes are about to leave, a wounded young boy from the village arrives. He says that the vampires have come for Belmont and want him to come to the village. Despite Gabriel clearly knowing that it's a trap, he agrees while Zobek stays to take care of the young lad. After fighting many <a href=\"\/vampire\/3015-117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-117\">vampires<\/a>, a vampire general who goes by the name of <a href=\"\/brauner\/3005-4244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4244\">Brauner<\/a> arrives. He wields a giant sword that he throws at Gabriel. Belmont catches the sword mid-flight and throws it back at him. After several throws, Gabriel gets a hold of the general, cuts the hand that was holding the sword off, catches the sword, plants the sword half way through the vampires face and starts stabbing it with his stake in the back. Once Brauner is dead, Gabriel prepares to leave. He's worshiped by the villagers and one of them shows him a secret passage into the vampire castle. Zobek stays behind as he has some unfinished business to attend to.<\/p><p style=\"\">The secret passage leads Belmont through the sewers. The vampire's defenses are strong but our hero is stronger. He eventually finds the key to the castle and enters the vampire's lair. He solves a variety of puzzles and the sun sets, meaning what used to be three or four<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1404736-952493_20100615_screen028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404736\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1404736-952493_20100615_screen028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404736\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/976\/1404736-952493_20100615_screen028.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Creepy Laura<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">attacking vampires turns into endless waves. Gabriel encounters Laura, a vampire who takes the form of a human. This Lord of Shadow is a female which surprises Gabriel, she's maintained her young girl looks despite being hundred of years old. She will tell Belmont where the queen is, if he plays her favorite board game, Vampire Wargame. After beating the vampire she disappears and Gabriel continues his quest through the castle.<\/p><p style=\"\">He arrives in the refectory where he witnesses a peculiar sight: a giant evil Butcher brings human limbs out to feed the ghouls. It's revealed that once the vampires are finished sucking all the blood out of the humans, they send it down to the kitchen where the butcher serves it to the ghouls. The problem is that the butcher has a key that Gabriel needs to progress. He faces off with the Evil Butcher who fights with a giant butcher knife. After an epic battle, Gabriel tries to take the giant knife away from the butcher with his cross, but the butcher's force makes it impossible. So Gabriel just lets the cross go, flinging the Butcher's knife into his skull. Gabriel then takes the knife and savagely finishes him off.<\/p><p style=\"\">Thanks to the Butcher's key, Gabriel makes his way to Dr. <a href=\"\/frankenstein\/3005-4977\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4977\">Frankenstein<\/a>'s lab. The doctor has since then passed, eaten by the queen for having created ungodly creations. After solving many complicated electrical puzzles, Belmont faces off with one of Frankenstein's creatures: a giant mechanical <a href=\"\/spider\/3015-1873\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1873\">spider<\/a> that Belmont defeats by simply making it run out of batteries. After the fight, he finds a red lens that will help him solve one of the many puzzles in the castle.<\/p><p style=\"\">After solving more complicated puzzles, Gabriel once again runs into <a href=\"\/laura\/3005-15732\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15732\">Laura<\/a>. Laura is annoyed for having lost against Gabriel in her game and sends her \"toys\" after him, giant dolls. After killing the dolls, Laura becomes violent and zaps Belmont to death. As Belmont kneels down to accept defeat, Marie appears. She tells him that it is not his time, that he must still go on. Gabriel refuses, saying that he's done \"questionable\" things and that he wants to join her in the afterlife. Laura apparently has the power to let her see the entire conversation. She's touched by the love between the two and resurrects Gabriel. This leaves Belmont to soldier on and face the next Lord of Shadow.<\/p><p style=\"\">After fighting his way through more of the castle and a clocktower, Gabriel must face one last enemy before the vampire queen: <a href=\"\/olrox\/3005-16064\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16064\">Olrox<\/a>, Brauner's brother and the vampire queen's right hand man. He wields two giant swords and vows to bring Gabriel's head to his superior. Gabriel ends up beating him by taking his sword and sticking it through his neck. He drains him of all his blood and uses the blood to solve a maze puzzle to open the door that leads him to the queen.<\/p><p style=\"\">The queen goes by the name of <a href=\"\/camilla\/3005-8461\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8461\">C<\/a>armilla. She reveals to Gabriel that what Cornell said was true: the Lords of Shadow were created by the founder of Gabriel's order. Carmilla used to be an excellent healer and pure of heart. When she transformed into a powerful spirit, what was left on earth became corrupt and turned into the vampire queen. Carmilla is seductive towards Gabriel, promising him eternal life and pleasure by her side. Gabriel refuses, to which the queen tells him that there is no such thing as bringing the dead back to life and that Marie is dead.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1404690-952493_20100615_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404690\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/976\/1404690-952493_20100615_screen005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404690\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/976\/1404690-952493_20100615_screen005.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Carmilla<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The queen unleashes hordes of vampires onto Gabriel and then turns into her real form, a giant vampire, a Lord of Shadow.<\/p><p style=\"\">After an epic fight, Carmilla decides that she has lost the fight and tries to flee. Gabriel catches on to her leg but is quickly kicked off. As he falls to his death, he throws his spiked whip that goes through Carmilla's chest. But that doesn't stop her, she starts flying next to one of the castle's many towers. Gabriel plants his feet onto the roof of the tower and pulls at his whip. His force is so strong that his pulling begins to make the tower collapse. He succeeds in pulling and impales Carmilla onto the tip of the tower that collapses... but it's still not over. Carmilla survives and Gabriel starts stabbing her with the tip of his combat cross, where the stake is built in. After enough quick stabbing, he plunges the cross into the Lord's chest and breaks the stake off, finally killing the vampire queen.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the slaughter, Gabriel gets a new part of the God Mask. Pan appears through a portal telling Gabriel that he's doing well. Belmont doesn't care anymore. The order has betrayed him and all of mankind. He wants answers and of course Pan doesn't give them. He just asks our hero how far he's willing to go for the truth. The final Lord is Death himself, Gabriel steps through Pan's portal which takes him to the the abyss where he can find the last lord. He's not fighting for the order anymore but for his love, Marie.<\/p><p style=\"\">He steps into Pan's portal and is teleported to a weird land near the abyss that will lead him to Death. He meets an old witch who goes by the name of <a href=\"\/baba-yaga\/3005-4384\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4384\">Baba Yaga<\/a>. She's crazy and keeps mentioning that the \"King of the Angels\" had told her of Gabriel's arrival. She can help Gabriel but first he must do something for her: retrieve her blue rose that is locked in a magic box. Belmont retrieves the key of the magic box (that was being held by possessed scarecrows) and Baba shrinks our hero so he can go into the box and retrieve the rose. After dodging all of the music box's traps (the music box plays original <a href=\"\/castlevania-ii-simons-quest\/3030-11820\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11820\">Castlevania 2<\/a> music), Gabriel is unshrunk and gives the rose to Baba. The witch respects their agreement and teleports Belmont to the Titan graveyard, just outside of Necromancer territory. It's explained that Baba Yaga is slaughtered by Zobek offscreen so she wouldn't \"interfere\" anymore.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel finds himself on the outskirts of the land of the dead. He makes his way through the graveyard and meets once again Pan. Gabriel is surprised to see the spirit here and Pan explains that only one of them can come out alive of this encounter. Gabriel is sick of all of Pan's riddles, that he wants the truth. Pan of course doesn't give it to him and turns into the Silver Warrior. Gabriel is forced to fight him and defeats<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1409598-30_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_055.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409598\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1409598-30_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_055.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409598\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/669\/1409598-30_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_055.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Pan in Silver Warrior form<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">him by stabbing him in the chest with the spirit's own sword. This is by far the least gruesome fight of the entire game. As Pan collapses, Gabriel asks him why he forced him to kill him. Pan answers that he was testing Gabriel and that he is ready. The only way to enter the Necromancer's territory is by spilling the blood of a God and that is what Gabriel has done. As Pan dies, Gabriel laments his fate, saying that he didn't deserve this. Yet, he decides to go on.<\/p><p style=\"\">He makes his way to the center of the land, the Crematory Oven. After slaughtering thousands of zombies, he makes it to the Oven where he encounters the Grave Digger who fights with a giant, scorching hot shovel. After an epic fight, Gabriel manages to open the oven, take the gravedigger's shovel and whack the beast on the head with it before pushing the Gravedigger into his own oven. As the beast falls to his death, he slings his tongues out which catch Gabriel and start dragging him down into the oven. Despite Gabriel using the shovel to hold himself from falling it breaks and Gabriel falls into the pit. He manages to hang on to the ledge and get a hold of a sharp rusted piece of metal which he uses to cut the beasts tongue, freeing himself. He climbs out of the oven and continues his desperate quest.<\/p><p style=\"\">He finally makes it into the Necromancer's Abyss. Gabriel's mental health is in shambles, he hasn't slept in days and has no pity for any of the enemies he crosses. He's called by Zobek the \"Prince of Shadow\". He soldiers on, killing necromancers and ends up climbing to the highest point of the abyss, where he meets Death. Death calls Gabriel a hypocrite, that Gabriel and he are one in the same. Death takes on the form of a giant skeleton dragon( the LAST titan) that flies around and spits acid at our hero. Gabriel climbs on to Death and crashes him into his own tower. He destroys him and the abyss begins to collapse. Gabriel manages to get to the platform where the final piece of the mask resides.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel puts the pieces together and assembles the God Mask. As he holds it in his hands, Zobek shows up. He congratulates Gabriel and his quest but says that it's time to end the charades and that the truth must be revealed. Zobek takes out the devil mask and puts it on his face, revealing that he's the final Lord of Shadow. As a Lord of Shadow, he was frustrated that the different Lords didn't unite to take on God and rule the world. By uniting their powers, they could easily trump God and make darkness invade the land. So Zobek decided to go to the deepest reaches of hell where he trained himself in the dark arts. He conjured a spell that kept the dead from going to heaven, cutting the<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/34651\/1551527-lordofthedead.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1551527\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/34651\/1551527-lordofthedead.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1551527\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/3\/34651\/1551527-lordofthedead.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Zobek, the final Lord of Shadow<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">world off from God. He tricked the order into sending a warrior (Gabriel) to solve the situation. Zobek knew that this warrior needed extreme motivation. So what he did was place the Devil Mask on Gabriel, making Gabriel kill his own wife. He also did the same thing for Claudia. To control Gabriel, he cast a spell on his gauntlet. The spell controlled Gabriel's magic powers and Zobek decides to once more use it on Gabriel, making him defenseless.<\/p><p style=\"\">After this grand speech, Zobek tells Gabriel that he was but a puppet, and that he served his master well. Gabriel did many terrible, sinful things during his quest and because God can't forgive him, he'll be banished to hell for eternity. Zobek zaps Gabriel to death and stands laughing as the final Lord possesses the mask and ultimate power. Suddenly a voice booms from the sky telling Zobek that he's not respecting the agreement and that he's out of line. Zobek is lit on fire and burns to death. Through the ashes emerges Satan himself, who picks up the God Mask. Satan has been wanting to take revenge on God who banished him and he finally has that chance. He's the one who's behind the entire thing, Zobek was just a puppet.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel is in limbo where thousands of spirits fly around him, ready to take him to the afterlife. Marie's ghost appears, telling all the spirits to back off, that if Gabriel dies than all hope is lost. The spirits agree and decide to give life back to Gabriel. Gabriel rises and confronts Satan. Satan explains that there is no point on fighting since Gabriel is going to hell one way or another because of the evil deeds he has committed. Gabriel replies that God is great and that he only has to ask for forgiveness and God will welcome him with open arms. Satan denies this, telling him that God does not love him since he's abandoned him. Gabriel knows this is false as he now possesses powers given to him by God. Satan, now wearing the God Mask, and Gabriel clash in an epic battle.<\/p><p style=\"\">As the battle rages on, Satan begins to realize that Belmont has the power of a God. Belmont uses all the powers he has and beats Satan with his own fists. However, Satan is able to stab Gabriel with his spear. This does nothing to Gabriel who simply takes it out. He then takes Satan in a choke hold. As Satan begins to realize that the battle is lost, he keeps on trying to convince Gabriel that God doesn't care about humankind anymore. Gabriel says that God's love is great and that He'd never abandon them. All of Belmont's godly powers unleash themselves and obliterate Satan. Exhausted, Gabriel falls to the ground as trapped spirits begin making their way towards the heavens.<\/p><p style=\"\">Marie's ghost appears once again. Gabriel begs for forgiveness to which she tells him that he's done well. Unfortunately, she too had lied to him: she can not be brought back to life. All hope leaves Gabriel's body and he wishes to die so he can be with her. Marie requests that he stay alive, as he deserves to. Still believing that the God Mask can bring the dead back, Gabriel wears it and he does indeed see his Marie as though she is living. But when he takes it off, she's a spirit again. This reveals that the God Mask was merely a tool to see the dead, bringing them back in a visual form. However, what is dead is dead. Marie flies off, telling Gabriel she loves him. Claudia appears for a brief instance, showing Gabriel that she forgives him. Belmont is left standing there as the camera pans onto the devil mask.<\/p><p style=\"\">The credits roll...<\/p><p style=\"\">An epilogue is then shown. A hooded man enters a cathedral. He walks at a quick pace. After briefly staring at a statue of Christ crucified he makes his way to an abandoned part of the cathedral, where he breaks down a wall. He arrives in a large tall room full of gothic statues. At this point, the man's feet leave the ground as he levitates. He levitates to a ledge that enters a big room with a giant stained glass window at the front of the cathedral. The man takes off his hood and is revealed to be Zobek. He begins talking to a man who's sitting on a throne in the shadows, telling him that for a prince of shadow, his hiding spot is strange. The man on the throne asks where Zobek has<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/34651\/1551529-zobekz.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1551529\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/34651\/1551529-zobekz.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1551529\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/3\/34651\/1551529-zobekz.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Future Zobek<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">been all this time and it's revealed that Zobek still works for Satan. Satan is preparing to march on earth once again and Zobek needs this person's help. He calls this person by his real name: Gabriel. Suddenly the man in the shadows reveals himself. It is indeed Gabriel, or what's left of him. Gabriel now goes by the name of Dracula. It's unclear how he became the lord of the vampires but Zobek states that Dracula must not stay in this state of self pity. Dracula suddenly disappears and Zobek tells him that Satan will turn him into one of his pets and that he must come out of the shadows. Suddenly Dracula grabs Zobek who teleports out of his robe and is revealed to be wearing a modern business suit. He pushes Dracula through the stained glass window and Dracula lands on a busy modern street. It's revealed that hundreds of years have passed since Gabriel defeated Satan. In this shocking turn of events Zobek asks Dracula aka Gabriel if he will help him defeat Satan. Dracula yells and disappears as Zobek simply walks away, leaving the game open for a sequel.<\/p><h2>DLC<\/h2><h3>Reverie<\/h3><p style=\"\">The first DLC available for Lords of Shadow, it allowed players to play as both Gabriel and Laura. Gabriel uses his standard moves and equipment while Laura has the ability to shoot lighting, pass through obstacles by turning into mist and heal HP by feeding on enemies.<\/p><p style=\"\">Laura summons Gabriel to Bernhardt castle. By killing the three Lords of Shadow, Gabriel unleashed an even bigger evil: the Forgotten One, an incredibly powerful demon whom the Brotherhood imprisoned deep in the center of the castle. The Forgotten One's seal is the reason why the 3 Lords's souls were forced to ascend to heaven originally.<\/p><p style=\"\">After opening the gate to the fortress, Gabriel and Laura travel through the ancient castle. They gather the blood of the three founders in order to open the gate to the Forgotten One's chamber. However, only dark beings can enter into the dimension where the Forgotten One is kept. To bypass this, Laura asks Gabriel to drink all of her blood. As a consequence, Laura dies and is thus freed from her eternal torment, while Gabriel becomes a creature of the night and steps through the gate to confront what awaits him.<\/p><h3>Resurrection<\/h3><p style=\"\">The second and last piece of DLC, it takes place in the Dimensional Rift, the prison where The Forgotten One was sealed.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel falls down to his knees, feeling pain caused by the presence of the Forgotten One and due to his recent transformation into a vampire.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/90729\/2483807-the-forgotten-one.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483807\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/90729\/2483807-the-forgotten-one.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2483807\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/9\/90729\/2483807-the-forgotten-one.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Gabriel faced the Forgotten One<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Shortly after that, a giant white armored hand comes out of the Lava and Gabriel hides behind a rock, while the Forgotten One emerges and starts to climb up the tower-like cave.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel follows the Forgotten One while avoiding this gaze (which instantly kills him if detected).<\/p><p style=\"\">At the top, the Forgotten One unleashes his essence upon the first Prison Seal, slowly destroying it. This weakens him greatly and he falls down to his knees. Gabriel charges towards the Forgotten One in an ingame-cutscene and successfully destroys the armor on the Forgotten One's right leg, exposing the black and green-glowing flesh beneath.<\/p><p style=\"\">After a fierce battle, the first Seal is finally broken and the essence returns to the Forgotten One who continues onward his path to freedom. Another platforming lava sequence where Gabriel must hide unfolds and eventually the Forgotten One uses the same pillar Gabriel is holding onto to destroy a giant gate. When the gate is destroyed, the Forgotten One throws the pillar in the lava, not knowing that Gabriel was on it, and walks away.<\/p><p style=\"\">On the middle on a platform, he finds the Forgotten One releasing his essence on the final Prison Seal. They fight again and Gabriel manages to break the face armor of the Forgotten One, exposing the right side of his face. Before he could finish it, the final PRison Seal breaks.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Forgotten One taunts Gabriel, stating he will inflict ten times the pain the Brotherhood inflicted on him as payback. As he prepares to absorb back the dark essence floating to him from the portal, Gabriel jumps in the air and and absorbs it himself, turning his hair white. The Forgotten One yells in anger and tries to crush Gabriel, but he teleports to safety, floating in the air. The Forgotten One yields and asks for mercy, calling Gabriel his <i>liege.<\/i> Without an answer, Gabriel slices the demon in half.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the final scene Gabriel looks at his Combat Cross and crushes it in his hand.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><h3><a href=\"\/gabriel-belmont\/3005-12350\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12350\">Gabriel Belmont<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">The game's main character, he's extremely tormented by the death of his beloved wife, Marie. He can't sleep since the death of his wife, as he's haunted by visions and nightmares. He's eaten up by vengeance and loses all humanity and compassion during the events of the game. All he wants to do is murder the creatures that are responsible for the death of his wife.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/marie-belmont\/3005-13751\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13751\">Marie Belmont<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">Gabriel's wife, she was murdered by axe, by Gabriel under the spell of Zobek and is the reason for why Belmont wants to kill every undead being on the planet. She communicates with Gabriel through visions and is being used by God as a vessel of hope.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/zobek\/3005-14647\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14647\">Zobek<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">This veteran is of the same Order as Gabriel. He's an experienced warrior and helps Belmont any way he can. However, he seems to have a secret agenda and something sinister to hide. He narrates the loading screens.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/pan\/3005-16294\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16294\">Pan<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">Pan is a mystical spirit of the forest. He takes many forms including a horse and an eagle. He speaks in riddles and sometimes helps Gabriel in his quest. He's very wise and seems to be pulling the strings from the background and he too seems to have a secret agenda.<\/p><h2>Cast<\/h2><p style=\"\">Many recognized actors have offered their voices for the game's characters. Gabriel Belmont is voiced by <a href=\"\/robert-carlyle\/3040-92994\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-92994\">Robert Carlyle<\/a>. Belmont's wife is voiced by <a href=\"\/natascha-mcelhone\/3040-92996\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-92996\">Natascha McElhone<\/a>. <a href=\"\/patrick-stewart\/3040-19670\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-19670\">Patrick Stewart<\/a> is also involved with the game as Zobek and the game's narrator, as is <a href=\"\/jason-isaacs\/3040-92995\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-92995\">Jason Isaacs<\/a> who voices Satan.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\">Lords of Shadow features the same free form 3D action combat as made popular by games such as <a href=\"\/devil-may-cry\/3025-147\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-147\">Devil May Cry<\/a> and <a href=\"\/god-of-war\/3025-244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-244\">God of War<\/a> . Gabriel uses his \"Combat Cross\", a cross that has a whip attached to it of and was drenched in Holy water letting it slay all manner of demons, werewolves, giant golems, and other monsters and undead featured in the <a href=\"\/castlevania\/3025-86\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-86\">Castlevania series<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The combat cross comes with two types of attacks: a heavy attack that deals a lot of damage onto one specific enemy and an area attack that's not as powerful but that sweeps around Gabriel keeping the monsters at bay. You can combine these attacks to form combos that you can purchase. These attacks can be executed in the air on both airborn and ground enemies with certain attacks such as the ground pound helpful in eliminating both enemies in the air and on the ground in one fluent combo.<\/p><p style=\"\">The cross can be upgraded in different ways. Killing opponents will get you combo points. These combo points can be spent on new combos<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33529\/1523435-952494_20100916_790screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1523435\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33529\/1523435-952494_20100916_790screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1523435\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/3\/33529\/1523435-952494_20100916_790screen001.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Cross in Action<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">for the Cross. All the main upgrades for the cross are usually story focused and happen when you enter a church with a tomb in which you can put your cross. These upgrades can range from a grappling hook to the ability to tear down walls. These upgrades allow you to access previously inaccessible places, like in Metroid.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel can carry multiple secondary weapons. You start off with daggers that you can pick up after defeating enemies or by smashing vases. You can upgrade these secondary weapons. For example, by upgrading your daggers, you can fire five daggers in a wave. Other secondary weapons include the Dark Crystal. This crystal is ultra powerful, killing all enemies on screen. To use the crystal, you must find three shards hidden around the environment. Other secondary weapons include Fairies that blow up upon contact with an enemy, Holy Water and a Shield.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel can also grab his enemies by hitting the right shoulder button. These grabs can be done from afar thanks to the cross's chain. Once you've grabbed an enemy, two circles will appear on the screen, one large circle that closes in on an inner circle. Once the outer circle becomes the inner one, you must hit any button to complete the mini game. This will usually result in the execution of the enemy. This mini game is also used during certain sequences such as when your falling off a mount or to finish off an enemy.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gabriel also possesses defensive moves. Gabriel can block certain attacks. When an attack is unblockable, the game will usually tell you this by making a part of the enemy glow. If you block an attack right before it hits, you can stun the enemy and execute a devastating counter attack. When the attack is too powerful to block, you can dodge roll in any direction.<\/p><h3>Platforming<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11660\/1523186-clos_tgs003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1523186\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11660\/1523186-clos_tgs003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1523186\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/11660\/1523186-clos_tgs003.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Epic Platforming<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">LoS has a lot of platforming. Gabriel can jump, swing and shimmy his way to safety. Most of the time, you jump from ledge to ledge. To climb up a ledge, you just have to orient the stick up and Gabriel will go up. Like in Uncharted, when Gabriel can make the jump, he pulls out his arm in the direction he can jump to. You can jump down from a ledge by just hitting down and the jump button. The grappling hook comes into play during platforming sequences. You can hook onto things that are shiny and swing around. You can also use it to climb up a wall. From there you can jump and crash through windows or use the swing to jump farther. Note that during these sequences, you cannot control the camera.<\/p><h3>Magic<\/h3><p style=\"\">Lords of Shadow wouldn't be a Castlevania game without magic. The game offers shadow and light magic that Gabriel can use thanks to amulets that are given to him throughout the story. Both of these magics have their own bars and can be activated when these bars are full. By activating light magic, every hit you land on an enemy increases your health. With shadow magic on, you're attacks deal out more damage. By combining the two, you can perform deadly combos.<\/p><p style=\"\">You can replenish your magic thanks to neutral energy that you can pick up after defeating enemies. However, you must choose whether you replenish you shadow or light magic. By fighting without getting hit, you fill up your focus meter. Once it is full, every hit you land automatically gives you neutral energy. You can increase your magic as well as your health by finding Magic Gems on dead soldiers. You can combine the magic with side weapons. For example, combining dark magic with the daggers makes for a dagger blast.<\/p><h3>Mounts<\/h3><p style=\"\">Lords of Shadow lets you ride mounts. Some of these mounts are given to you while others are enemies that you must first defeat. These mounts each have their own moves and can be used to solve puzzles. Most mounts can be easily killed once your done with them.<\/p><h4>Horse<\/h4><p style=\"\">You start the game on a horse and ride it at high speeds during different parts of the game. You can perform localised attacks on enemies that are following you. You can hit the person riding a beast or hit the beast. You can also dodge attacks and will sometimes start slipping off the horse at which point you must do a quick time event.<\/p><h4>Spider<\/h4><p style=\"\">You can mount giant spiders. You have both a heavy and light attack which usually involves slashing at the enemies. The spider can solve many puzzles in the environment. It can bring down a wall or a tree to make a bridge. It can also create a bridge from web which the player can use to cross large gaps.<\/p><h4>Troll<\/h4><p style=\"\">The troll is one of the most powerful creatures in Lords of Shadow. It has a basic, strong attack where the beast flails its arms before smashing them on the ground for a powerful area attack. It can also destroy big walls to clear a path for Belmont.<\/p><h4>Warg<\/h4><p style=\"\">The warg has two different types of attacks. The first one is a claw attack and the other is a charge attack that can instantly kill an enemy. Wargs can jump really far by making the Warg sprint and then jumping. Wargs can also climb vines, which Belmont can't do on his own.<\/p><h4>Warthog<\/h4><p style=\"\">The warthog is similar to the warthogs found in the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in their design. The warthog can use its horn to ram the enemies and can ram through doors.<\/p><h3>Enemies<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1409537-10_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_131.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409537\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1409537-10_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_131.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409537\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/669\/1409537-10_castlevania_e3final_konami_compressed_131.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A Giant Golem<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">You fight many different creatures in Lords of Shadow from trolls to golems. Boss battles must be handled in specific ways and some enemies that were bosses in previous stages of the game can become regular enemies in later stages. Some enemies such as trolls, boars or spiders can be mounted and used to wreak havoc or solve puzzles in the environment. For example, the spider can create a bridge that you can walk on and boars can break down doors. You also end up fighting giant golems. These golems can only be destroyed by being climbed on and destroying certain parts of their body. Those fights are particularly reminiscent of <a href=\"\/shadow-of-the-colossus\/3030-6522\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6522\">Shadow of the Colossus<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Journal<\/h3><p style=\"\">All you need to know is stored in your journal. The opening page of the journal gives you information about how many Magic Gems you've collected and the state of your cross. You can also view scrolls that you've picked up. One of the most important things of the journal is the combo store. You can buy new combos directly from the journal with experience points that you've earned during the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">The journal gives you important information about each creature you encounter, telling you what they're weakness's are and their story. The journal also gives you in depth details about some of the story's main characters.<\/p><h2>Development History<\/h2><p style=\"\">Originally unveiled at E3 2008 as 'Lords of Shadow' with a brief teaser, no other details were shown of the game for nearly a year. Lords of Shadow was then featured in <a href=\"\/kojima-productions\/3010-2057\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2057\">Kojima Productions<\/a> web teaser for E3 2009 in way of the all-important mask though the viral marketing campaign. This led to much fervent discussion across message boards as the game was theorized to be a spin-off of <a href=\"\/hideo-kojima\/3040-63395\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\">Hideo Kojima<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/metal-gear\/3025-5\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-5\">Metal Gear<\/a> franchise. At Konami's E3 press conference, it was revealed that the game was Lords of Shadow and was still being developed by MercurySteam. Kojima Productions, and in particular Hideo Kojima, would be overlooking the production, with <a href=\"\/david-cox\/3040-803\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-803\">David Cox<\/a> serving as the project producer and Enric Alvarez as director.<\/p><p style=\"\">Kojima said that his involvement is limited to \"[fixing] things on [his] creative viewpoint\". Once penned onto the game, he asked for several redesigns to be carried out to the original project. The extent of these redesigns is not fully known, but they were done to pull the game in line with the Castlevania franchise. Kojima gives the example of asking MercurySteam to redesign Gabriel, and give him a more \"heroic\" face, which now resembles more that of Robert Carlyle, while at first was more barbaric.<\/p><p style=\"\">Lords of Shadow uses a proprietary engine developed in house. Cox stated at E3 2009 that the game was approximately 50% complete, and that it was running at a smooth 30 frames per second. He said that forcing the game to run at 60 frames per second was not one of the team's main goals.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p style=\"\">The music for Castlevania: Lords of Shadow was composed by Oscar Araujo and performed by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra.

Over time, the annihilator charges up (its progress can be determined by the red ring around it. If it's green, it's ready). A player from either team may activate the Annihilator for $250, which destroys all enemy bots (only dealing heavy damage to Jackbots) and damages enemy players. The Annihilator is a great way to prevent the other team from downing your moneyball if their bots are about to break through.<\/p><h3>Ejectors<\/h3><p style=\"\">Ejectors are two-part mechanisms: The activator is a floating \"!\" that is similar in appearance to the annihilator, but is smaller. The second part is a large, yellow \"!\" pad somewhere nearby. For $50, any player may activate an ejector, which will immediately deal damage to all enemies (bots and players) standing within the pad's radius, and will cause severe knockback to survivors.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> XP(SP3)\/Vista\/Windows 7<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 2 GHz Processor<\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> DirectX 9.0c\/Shader3.0 compatible, VRAM 512 MB (NVIDIA GeForce 7800 series or ATI Radeon X1900)<\/li><li><strong>DirectX\u00ae:<\/strong> 9.0c<\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive:<\/strong> 2 GB of free space<\/li><li><strong>Sound:<\/strong> DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card<\/li><\/ul><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/2117039-box_mnc.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/2117039-box_mnc.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/2117039-box_mnc.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2117039-box_mnc.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/2117039-box_mnc.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/2117039-box_mnc.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/2117039-box_mnc.png"},"name":"Monday Night Combat"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Civilization V is the latest game in the <a href=\"\/civilization\/3025-93\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-93\">Civilization<\/a> franchise, developed by <a href=\"\/firaxis-games\/3010-361\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-361\">Firaxis Games<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/2k-games\/3010-360\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-360\">2K Games<\/a>.

Unit stacking from previous games has been removed, replaced with a one military unit-per-tile system. Ranged units also make a return to the franchise.

Cities can also fire at sieging units, softening them up for a counterattack. After a city has been conquered, it can be: razed, annexed, or transformed into a puppet state.<\/p><p style=\"\">Naval movement and combat has also been changed, as any land unit can \"embark\", entering a water tile and automatically turning into a transport ship.

City boundaries can grow, one tile at a time, to a maximum of 3 tiles outwards, favoring food oriented tiles like grasslands over production based tiles like forests.

But if they go to war, the agreement is cancelled.<\/p><p style=\"\">A civilization's economy is reflected by the amount of gold they generate. <a href=\"\/gold\/3055-83\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-83\">Gold<\/a> can be used in a vast array of things, from the maintenance of units, buildings, and roads, to buying and upgrading units. Gold can also be used in diplomacy to improve relations with other civilizations or city states, or used as a bartering tool. Gold is generated from tiles such as coastlines or rivers, and the trading post improvement can be built to generate further income. Luxury resources, trade routes, pillaging tiles, capturing cities, and disbanding extra units will also provide gold.<\/p><h3>Happiness<\/h3><p style=\"\">Happiness is a factor that determines how willing a civilization's citizen are to work and cooperate with their leader, and how well they fight in their armies. Unlike previous games, happiness is now a civilization-wide value. The larger a civilization gets, the more unhappy their citizens become. The number of cities in a civilization and the population of those cities negatively affect happiness, and annexed cities compound the issue. If unhappiness is not resolved, rebel units will eventually rise up in the civilization's territory and attack the civilization.<\/p><p style=\"\">Happiness is generated through the presence of luxury resources, the construction of entertainment buildings, and the discovery of Natural Wonders throughout the world. Several Social Policies and Wonders also help to alleviate unhappiness. Positive happiness will eventually build up into a Golden Age for a civilization, granting them additional gold and production (and culture in <a href=\"\/sid-meiers-civilization-v-gods-kings\/3030-37508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37508\">Gods &amp; Kings<\/a>) for 10 turns.<\/p><h3>Great People<\/h3><p style=\"\">Great People are special units generated by Great People points. These units can build a special Great Person tile improvement, activate a special action unique to that type of Great People, or can be used to generate a short Golden Age. Great People points are generated from their corresponding specialists and from certain Wonders, except Great Generals, who gain points from land combat.<\/p><table><thead><tr><th>Name<\/th><th>Activated Ability<\/th><th>Tile Improvement<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Great Artist<\/td><td><b>Culture Bomb:<\/b> Tiles around the Great Artist immediately belong to the civilization, regardless of previous owner<\/td><td><b>Landmark:<\/b> +6 Culture<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Great Engineer<\/td><td><b>Hurry Production:<\/b> Provides a great amount of production to the building or Wonder in the city's queue<\/td><td><b>Manufactory:<\/b> +4 Production, +5 with Chemistry<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Great General<\/td><td><b>Combat Boost (passive):<\/b> Increases the combat ability of land units within 2 tiles of the Great General<\/td><td><b>Citadel:<\/b> Defensive boost, 3 damage to enemies around it<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Great Merchant<\/td><td><b>Conduct Trade Mission:<\/b> Grants a large amount of gold and boosts city state influence<\/td><td><b>Customs House:<\/b> +4 Gold, +6 with Economics<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Great Scientist<\/td><td><b>Discover Technology:<\/b> Instantly discover any technology<\/td><td><b>Academy:<\/b> +6 Science, +8 with Scientific Theory<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Resources<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are 3 types of resources in Civilization V: strategic resources, luxury resources, and bonus resources. Strategic resources unlock different units and buildings that rely on them, such as Iron for Swordsmen. These resources can be acquired by building the appropriate improvement upon them like <a href=\"\/mine\/3035-1071\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1071\">mine<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/well\/3055-2424\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2424\">well<\/a>. Strategic resources had a huge overhaul in Civilization V, and there are now limited quantities of a resource per source. If the source is depleted no further units or buildings that require that resource can be built. In addition, if a civilization loses the resource, their units will suffer a severe combat penalty. The strategic resources are: <a href=\"\/horse\/3015-3114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3114\">horses<\/a>, iron, coal, oil, aluminum, and <a href=\"\/uranium\/3055-1158\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1158\">uranium<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Luxury resources are rare resources like spices, whales, or gems. These resources often provide gold boost to the tile it is on, and more importantly, happiness to a civilization. Each unique luxury resource a civilization holds grants it 4 happiness points, and extra luxuries can be traded for gold or more luxuries. Additional luxury resources, such as citrus and truffles, were added in <a href=\"\/sid-meiers-civilization-v-gods-kings\/3030-37508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37508\">Gods &amp; Kings<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Bonus resources like <a href=\"\/cow\/3015-3108\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3108\">cows<\/a> or <a href=\"\/fish\/3015-3780\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3780\">fish<\/a> can help a civilization grow bigger. These types of resources provide additional food or production to tile, and can be improved by tile improvements. A city working a tile with the bonus resource will get the full benefit of that resource, and many bonus resources can be further improved with specific buildings.<\/p><h3><b>Wonders<\/b><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275278\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/45471\/1275278-civilization_v_pc_002.jpg\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/45471\/1275278-civilization_v_pc_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275278\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/4\/45471\/1275278-civilization_v_pc_002.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Hagia Sophia in the Reveal Trailer<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Wonders are special one-time buildings any civilization can build, and provides massive bonuses to the builder.

Furthermore, the combat system was reworked, putting a bigger emphasis on a balanced army composition and introducing naval melee units. Other additions and changes include 27 new units, 13 new buildings, 9 new wonders, and 9 new playable civilizations, as well as 3 new scenarios including a <a href=\"\/steampunk-machinery\/3055-2329\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2329\">steampunk<\/a>-inspired one.<\/p><p style=\"\">The expansion pack was released June 19, 2012 in North America, and June 22, 2012 worldwide.

To this end several new mechanics were introduced, like archaeology and player-managed international trade routes. The culture has been complemented with tourism - tourism being the offensive part of culture, while conventional culture-points defend against tourism of other Civs. The social policies have been greatly expanded and gained multi-tiered Ideologies, which play a greater role in international diplomacy. The World Congress makes a return from previous Civ games, allowing Civs to vote on various resolutions, like the ban of nuclear weapons or a world ideology.<\/p><p style=\"\">Furthermore the add-on includes 9 new civilizations, 8 new wonders, 20 new units and 2 new scenarios.

Unbeknownst to the other Assassins, his consciousness is confronted with a challenge by the Animus and the \"digital ghost\" of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13227\" href=\"\/subject-16\/3005-13227\/\"> Subject 16<\/a>; Desmond must relive one last experience from the life of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, in order to reconstruct his fractured mind and awaken from his coma. It is revealed that the primary problem is that Desmond was already on the brink of going insane because of the crossover in his mind between his own memories and those of Ezio and their mutual ancestor Altair Ibn la-Ahad. In order to seperate their memories from his own and save himself, Desmond must synchronize his mind with a \"key memory\" that actually connects himself, Altair and Ezio together. Desmond begins reliving Ezio's later life in which he questions his life as an Assassin and how his life would've been had he made different decisions.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ezio embarks on a spiritual journey to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1100\" href=\"\/masyaf\/3035-1100\/\"> Masyaf<\/a> in a journey of self-discovery. Upon arrival, he discovers that Masyaf has been conquered by <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2655\" href=\"\/knights-templar\/3015-2655\/\"> Templars<\/a>. Upon infiltration of Masyaf, Ezio finds an ancient library chamber which can only be opened by five seals hidden in the ancient Ottoman city of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3680\" href=\"\/constantinople\/3035-3680\/\"> Constantinople<\/a>. Within Constantinople, he finds a Templar threat forming in the region, threatening to destabilize it, and must defeat it as he defeated the Borgia in the past in order to both recover the seals and bring peace to Turkey. At the same time, the seals themselves are made of ancient technology like the Pieces of Eden; using them allows Ezio to relive the memories of Altair in much the same way that the Animus allows Desmond to relive the memories of Ezio.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the end, Ezio unlocks the library room with the seals, and discovers that in truth, it is not a library, but a tomb; the final resting place of Altair, who sealed himself in with a Piece of Eden and a sixth seal showing his final moments. At this moment, the key memory takes place; standing in front of the body of Altair, Ezio turns and addresses Desmond, whom he somehow senses is watching him from centuries in the future, expressing his hope that Desmond will be able to find the answers to the questions that eluded Ezio during his lifetime. With his mind repaired, Desmond is contacted by Jupiter, one of The Ones Who Came Before, who gives him a grim vision of the end of the previous Human civilization, a doomsday which is rapidly approaching again, before giving Desmond another vision, of the location of a secret cache of technology, failed attempts to prevent the end of days, which the Assassins can hopefully use to save mankind. At this, Desmond awakens, and tells his friends he knows what he needs to do, only for them to reveal that they also somehow knew about it, and have taken him to the location while he was unconscious.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\"><b>Assassin's Creed: Revelations<\/b> plays similarly to its predecessors, evolving the current formula, as well as presenting new gameplay additions. New features include:<\/p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Ezio is now in possession of a Hookblade. This hookblade is not only usable in close combat to pull enemies in but also allows him to use various zipwires scattered throughout the city and make corner chase breaker movements.<\/li><li>A new crafting system has been implemented into the game which will allow players to craft over three hundred types of bombs from 3 categories: lethal, tactical and diversion. Ezio can carry up to 15 bombs.<\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3015-6193\" href=\"\/eagle-vision\/3015-6193\/\"> Eagle Vision<\/a> is now 'Eagle Sense.' It will allow you to focus on a particular character and is described as: \"You'll get an approximation of where he will go. If you're able to detect the path a guard will take, you can run ahead, set a bomb, and create a trap or an ambush.\"<\/li><li>Assassins' Dens will act as the new 'Borgia Towers.' These dens are placed throughout the city and the player will need to complete set tasks in order to overthrow the Templar influence before they can use the den. Ubisoft have said that there will be a larger variety of methods\/tasks that will allow the player to take these dens. Once a player is in control of a den they will be able to refurbish buildings in the region as well as set the behaviour of guards. In addition to this, players will be able to set a 'Master Assassin' to control the den so that they absolutely cannot be taken by the Templar. If you are unable to make it to a den that is currently under attack, you will be able to send your assassin recruits to defend it.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">Similar to <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-31001\" href=\"\/assassins-creed-brotherhood\/3030-31001\/\"> <\/a><\/i><i>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood<\/i>, this game features a multiplayer component.

Ethan then gets blamed for the murders of the two cops and has to find where Serial Killer X has gone in order to prove his innocence.<\/p><p style=\"\">During his investigation, he comes across <a href=\"\/malcolm-vanhorn\/3005-1084\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1084\"> Malcolm Vanhorn<\/a>, a friend of Ethan\u2019s father. Malcolm guides Ethan along, seeming to know more than he is letting on.

Ethan also meets up with Rose, who provides him with an upgraded <a href=\"\/taser\/3055-748\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-748\"> Taser<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">During the game, there is a common theme that runs along side the main story line, explained during the loading screens, often with text. These boxes of text describe that the homeless people who live in the worst parts of the city have suddenly started committing unexplained acts of violence against any and all who cross their path, including you. The text also explain that birds have also been affected, dying in large quantities due to unexplained brain tumors. These event are implied that they are not only related to each other, but to Serial Killer X.<\/p><p style=\"\">A sequel, <i><\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/condemned-2-bloodshot\/3030-20465\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20465\"><i>Condemned 2: Bloodshot<\/i><\/a>, was released on March 11, 2008.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/921371-cp_0134.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921371\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/921371-cp_0134.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921371\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/921371-cp_0134.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Ethan fighting an addict with a small pipe.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><i>Condemned: Criminal Origins<\/i> primarily focuses on its <a href=\"\/first-person-melee\/3015-5562\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5562\"> melee<\/a> and crime solving concepts, rarely allowing the player to get a hold of <a href=\"\/gun\/3055-118\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-118\"> firearms<\/a>. The weapons are mainly of the melee type such as <a href=\"\/pipe\/3055-229\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-229\"> pipes<\/a>, <a href=\"\/sledgehammer\/3055-302\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-302\"> sledgehammers<\/a>, <a href=\"\/fire-axe\/3055-1305\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1305\"> fire axes<\/a>, 2x4's, etc. The investigation aspect of the game has players searching for fingerprints and examining bodies for signs of the cause of death. The forensic tools that players use in these situations are also automatically equipped when required. The game was a launch title for the <a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\"> 360<\/a> and even now is still held in high regard for its atmosphere.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Taser that Ethan can use will stun enemies for a short period of time, allowing him to either get in a free hit, escape, or steal the victim's weapon right out of their hand. The upgraded Taser that Ethan eventually acquires will not only stun enemies but will also drop them to the ground. The majority of the game is set in areas with dim lighting or no lighting at all. As such, the player will almost always need to have Ethan's flashlight on in order to see.<\/p><p style=\"\"><i>Condemned: Criminal Origins<\/i> features unique artificial intelligence that makes enemy encounters unpredictable. When an enemy needs a weapon, they'll look around frantically and can rip pipes off of walls or pick anything up off the ground. They may run away and disappear into the darkness at random and then ambush the player as they round a corner. When an enemy has received a strong beating, they may fall to their knees. At this point, the player can perform one of four possible finishing moves: Ram, Slam, Snap, or Punch.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>Melee Weapons<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4757\/220432-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220432\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4757\/220432-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220432\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4757\/220432-6.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Ethan wielding a shovel<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Melee weapons are more common than firearms in <i>Condemned<\/i>. Melee weapons differ in appearance and stats that include damage, range, speed, and blocking efficiency. Generally, the smaller the melee weapon, the less damage it does but the faster it swings. Some of the melee weapons are required to gain entry to different areas in the game. The Fire Axe is used to chop down wooden doors, the shovel is used to cut electrical wires keeping a door locked, a sledgehammer is used to break traditional locks, and a crowbar is used to pry open doors and safes.<\/p><ul><li>2x4 (Bolts, Nails, Burning)<\/li><li>Clothes Rack<\/li><li>Conduit<\/li><li>Crowbar<\/li><li>Desk Drawer<\/li><li>Desktop<\/li><li>Fire Axe<\/li><li>Fireplace Poker<\/li><li>Handrail<\/li><li>Large Plank<\/li><li>Locker Door<\/li><li>Mannequin Arm<\/li><li>Paper Cutter<\/li><li>Pipe (Steam, Gas, Large, Small)<\/li><li>Rebar (Bent, Concrete, Straight)<\/li><li>Shovel<\/li><li>Sign<\/li><li>Sledgehammer<\/li><li>Stick<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><b>Firearms<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4757\/220533-14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220533\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4757\/220533-14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220533\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4757\/220533-14.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Ethan with a handgun<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Firearms are very uncommon in <i>Condemned<\/i>.

The result is an RPG with many of the most common Star Wars themes, such as good versus evil, and tropes (everything from starships to <a href=\"\/lightsaber\/3055-70\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-70\">lightsabers<\/a> are present).<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">KOTOR's gameplay consists of two parts, combat and dialog. The combat is <a href=\"\/turn-based\/3015-192\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn based<\/a>, although the animations give the illusion of <a href=\"\/real-time-combat\/3015-2332\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\">real-time combat<\/a>. The player may pause the game at any point during combat to get their bearings and rethink their strategy. The combat is based on Wizard of the Coast's d20 system. Your character may be equipped with a long-range weapon such as a <a href=\"\/blaster\/3055-478\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-478\">blaster<\/a>, or a short-range weapon such as a <a href=\"\/sword\/3055-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">sword<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/lightsaber\/3055-70\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-70\">lightsaber<\/a>. In addition to your weapons, you can use force powers that your character has learned throughout the course of the game, as well as those of your companions. Special combat moves such as \"Flurry\" may be activated at any time during combat, which will increase your attack speed, your damage, or your chance of dealing a critical hit. To unlock abilities such as these, one must earn them through points gained by leveling up. There is a good variety of abilities and there are many options for customizing a character to fit the desires of the player.<\/p><p style=\"\">The other half of gameplay is the dialog where you interact with the NPC's through complex <a href=\"\/dialogue-trees\/3015-77\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-77\">dialog trees<\/a>.

The player is encouraged to build an emotional connection with their crewmates, to learning their back-stories and even fall in love with them. The game tracks the players choices to determine their alignment to either the dark or light side. All characters in KOTOR are voiced with exception of the main character, who remains unheard during dialogue sequences, though the player may hear numerous grunts and battles cries during combat.<\/p><h3>Character Creation<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/118\/596651-facesoffemrevans.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596651\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/118\/596651-facesoffemrevans.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596651\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/118\/596651-facesoffemrevans.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Female character faces<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/118\/596652-facesofrevan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596652\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/118\/596652-facesofrevan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-596652\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/118\/596652-facesofrevan.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Male character faces<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The main character in KOTOR has a <a href=\"\/customizable-characters\/3015-155\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">customizable appearance<\/a> and skillset, with the ability to be either male or female at the outset, as well as the choice of three player classes.

This sequel was generally well-regarded, but was often criticized for its lack of polish and lackluster ending, both the results of a rushed production schedule. Large portions of the game, including a whole planet and many more options on Malachor were excised from the game at the last minute due to deadline concerns. Obsidian included many of the cut assets on the PC game disc, allowing mod teams to recreate the content they were forced to cut. The gameplay was greatly improved, but most players simply did not regard KOTOR II as highly as they did with the original.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rumors circulated that BioWare would be making a Knights of the Old Republic MMO. On the last day of E3 2008, <a href=\"\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts<\/a> CEO, <a href=\"\/john-riccitiello\/3040-65707\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-65707\">John Riccitiello<\/a> made several comments about a KOTOR MMO, suggesting that it had been the MMO Bioware had been working on. On October 21, 2008, Bioware and <a href=\"\/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc\/3010-644\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts<\/a> officially announced <a href=\"\/star-wars-the-old-republic\/3030-24205\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24205\">Star Wars: The Old Republic<\/a>, the much rumored KOTOR MMO. <a href=\"\/star-wars-the-old-republic\/3030-24205\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24205\">Star Wars: The Old Republic<\/a> was released on the December 20, 2011 in North America and Europe, for PC only. The game takes place 300 years after the original Knights of the Old Republic series, and takes place aproxamitly 3,600 years before '<a href=\"\/star-wars\/3025-551\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars: Episodes I-VI<\/a>'.<\/p><h2>Cut Content<\/h2><p style=\"\">Although the cut content in the original Knights of the Old Republic was not as significant as the content that had to be cut from The Sith Lords, a few things were, including one planet that was mentioned in pre-release videos, a dark side romance option, and a brief encounter with Dead-Eye Duncan on Manaan.<\/p><p style=\"\">The planet, called Sleyheron, was going to be a volcanic world controlled by the Hutts, a slaving center. This planet was supposed to have a Star Map on it, but was likely removed early in the development process to allow Bioware to focus more on their other five main planets. The planet Sleyheron is briefly mentioned in the game on Korriban by Yuthura Ban. It is also mentioned in a side-quest in KOTOR II, where Vogga the Hutt agrees to ship some of his fuel reserves from Sleyheron to Citadel Station, above Telos IV.<\/p><p style=\"\">Also cut was an option for female Dark Side players who had fallen in love with Carth to repent at the very end of the game. After defeating Malak, Carth would board the Star Forge alone and convince Revan to give up her dark ways. Revan would kill Bastila, and remain with Carth aboard the Star Forge as the Republic forces destroyed it. In this ending, the Ebon Hawk would be destroyed, and all of her crew would be dead by the end of the game. This ending has been recreated via fan-made mods for the PC release of KOTOR.<\/p><p style=\"\">The other known piece of cut content is on Manaan. If the player defeats Bendak Starkiller in the deathmatch on Taris, later on Manaan, Dead-Eye Duncan will appear in the hangar, having escaped the destruction of Taris, and will ask if he can use your duelist name from Taris, The Mysterious Stranger. This has also been re-created via PC mods.<\/p><p style=\"\">Also, an early development idea was for there to be a subplot involving clones in KOTOR, but the idea was nixed by LucasArts so that KOTOR would not steal the thunder from the upcoming 'Attack of the Clones' film.<\/p><h2>System Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum<\/h3><ul><li>Windows 98 \/ 98SE \/ ME \/ 2000 \/ XP \/ 7<\/li><li>Intel Pentium III 1.00 GHz or AMD Athlon 1.00 GHz<\/li><li>128 MB RAM required for Windows 98, 256 MB RAM required for Windows ME\/2000\/XP<\/li><li>32 MB OpenGL 1.4 compatible PCI or AGP<\/li><li>DirectX 9.0b compatible Audio Device required<\/li><li>4.0 GB of free hard drive space required<\/li><li>4X Speed CD-ROM drive required<\/li><li>Keyboard and mouse required<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><i>*3D Transform Lighting (T&amp;L) Capability required<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\"><i>**Microsoft DirectX 9.0b is included on this CD.<\/i><\/p><h3><b>Recommended<\/b><\/h3><ul><li>1.60 GHZ AMD or equivalent Intel processor<\/li><li>ATI Radeon 9200 or better, NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti or better<\/li><li>512 MB RAM<\/li><\/ul><h3>Supported Chipsets<\/h3><ul><li>ATI Radeon 8500 \/ 9000 \/ 9200 \/ 9500 \/ 9600 \/ 9700 \/ 9800<\/li><li>NVIDIA GeForce 2 \/ 3 \/ 4 \/ 5 FX family<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/3699\/1831644-kotor_cover.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3699\/1831644-kotor_cover.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/3699\/1831644-kotor_cover.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3699\/1831644-kotor_cover.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/3699\/1831644-kotor_cover.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/3699\/1831644-kotor_cover.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/3699\/1831644-kotor_cover.jpg"},"name":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4005\/242765-geralt2nj7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242765\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4005\/242765-geralt2nj7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242765\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4005\/242765-geralt2nj7.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Witcher is an action role playing game, developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2890\" href=\"\/cd-projekt-red-sp-z-oo\/3010-2890\/\" slug=\"cd-projekt-red-sp-z-oo\">CD Projekt Red Studio<\/a> and published by CD Projekt RED STUDIO in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1722\" href=\"\/poland\/3035-1722\/\" slug=\"poland\">Poland<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"\/atari\/3010-182\/\" slug=\"atari\">Atari<\/a> for rest of the world. The game is based on a series of books written by Andrzej Sapkowski commonly called, <i>The Witcher Saga<\/i>. The game was released world wide on October 30, 2007.<\/p><h2>The Enhanced Edition<\/h2><p style=\"\">CD Projekt released an Enhanced Edition of The Witcher in September 2008, featuring additional content, bug fixes, and both sound and graphical improvements. Most prominently featuring a complete rewrite and rerecording of the entire dialogue which comprises of more then 5000 lines. This is likely due to the criticism of the Polish to English and German translations of the first, specifically of those who are fans of the novels the game is based off. It contains two official mods titled \"The Price of Neutrality\" and \"Side Effects\" adding approximately 5 hours of additional gameplay time and 2 new erotic cards. On top of these additions a mod editor was packed in as well, which allows users to create their own custom content. The enhanced version also decreases the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-106\" href=\"\/loading-screens\/3015-106\/\" slug=\"loading-screens\">loading times<\/a> by as much as 80%, provides support for subtitles, and showcases new NPC models as well as more character animations during conversations. The Enhanced Edition was released in retail stores with extras such as the aforementioned improvements as well as additional in-game content, a making-of DVD, a music CD, a short story by Andrzej Sapkowski, a game guide, and a map of the game world. Later retail releases (which were budget priced at $10) removed most of these extras and contained two game discs, a music CD, making-of DVD, and game guide. The Enhanced Edition has also been released as a downloadable patch for anyone who already had a copy of The Witcher, and includes all of the aforementioned in-game extras. The game makes use of Bioware's Aurora Engine.<\/p><h2><b>Director's Cut<\/b><\/h2><p style=\"\">CD Projekt released the Director's Cut patch to North American players on July 31, 2009. The patch removed censorship in the game (which was largely censored nudity on the erotic cards) and made the game the exact same version that is available internationally. The patch is available on <a href=\"http:\/\/thewitcher.com\/the-witcher\/1\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">thewitcher.com<\/a> as patch 1.5 and is to be used after installing the Enhanced Edition. Any version of the game sold through digital distribution services such as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-718\" href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" slug=\"steam\">Steam<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2378\" href=\"\/direct2drive\/3015-2378\/\" slug=\"direct2drive\">Direct2Drive<\/a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\" href=\"\/good-old-games\/3015-2379\/\" slug=\"good-old-games\">Good Old Games<\/a> has both the Enhanced Edition and Director's Cut content included in the download.<\/p><h2>Mac Release<\/h2><p style=\"\">In April of 2012, a few weeks before the Enhanced Edition release of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28178\" href=\"\/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings\/3030-28178\/\" slug=\"the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings\">Witcher 2<\/a>, the Witcher was updated on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-718\" href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" slug=\"steam\">Steam<\/a> to support <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4790\" href=\"\/steam-play\/3015-4790\/\" slug=\"steam-play\">Steam Play<\/a>, which added Mac support. New buyers and previous purchasers alike now own a Mac version of the game.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">In the game the player takes the role of Geralt, commonly known as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2039\" href=\"\/geralt-of-rivia\/3005-2039\/\" slug=\"geralt-of-rivia\">Geralt of Rivia<\/a>, who is one of the very few remaining \" <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3876\" href=\"\/witchers\/3015-3876\/\" slug=\"witchers\">Witchers<\/a>\", professional monster slayers with unique abilities. The game uses a commonly used formula, one in which the main character suffers from <a data-ref-id=\"3015-286\" href=\"\/amnesia\/3015-286\/\" slug=\"amnesia\">amnesia<\/a> and it is up to the player to trace and discover his past. In the opening scene we see Geralt lying unconscious. He is later discovered by other witchers and is brought to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2493\" href=\"\/kaer-morhen\/3035-2493\/\" slug=\"kaer-morhen\">Kaer Morhen<\/a>, the witcher's <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2308\" href=\"\/fortress\/3035-2308\/\" slug=\"fortress\">fortress<\/a>. The only thing that Geralt remembers at this point in time is that he was brutally injured few years back trying to defend non-humans. As the story unfolds, Geralt gradually learns about his unmatched witcher skills and also his identity. The story is divided into 5 <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4749\" href=\"\/chapters\/3015-4749\/\" slug=\"chapters\">chapters<\/a>, and each chapter represents a different area. The Witcher also uses a choice, or morality, based system of story progression in which the player may choose which path to walk down to fill in Geralt's memories as well as influence the present. However, unlike other games where the choice is between good and evil, the Witcher often gives the player the choice between the lesser of two evils, a theme that comes up a great deal in the novel. Players are also not made aware of the consequences of their actions until much later in the story, giving the game a much more \"real-world\" feel, rather than something you can simply reload and try again from.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><h3>Geralt of Rivia<\/h3><p style=\"\">Main Article: <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2039\" href=\"\/geralt-of-rivia\/3005-2039\/\" slug=\"geralt-of-rivia\">Geralt of Rivia<\/a><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4005\/242767-geralt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242767\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4005\/242767-geralt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-242767\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4005\/242767-geralt.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Geralt of Rivia<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Geralt is a witcher, a human being who has undergone several rituals to mutate him, giving him supernatural reflexes and poison tolerance at the cost of making him sterile.

Perhaps the most shocking thing about him is that he actually is an incredibly skilled and revered bard, his reputation often earning him well-paying work in taverns across the land. Though he often talks in circles and pontificates, he is Geralt's closest and truest friend.

The heavy style lets the player inflict heavy damage on the enemies at the cost of speed. This combat style is helpful against larger and\/or stronger foes. Lastly, the group style is best when the player is being attacked by enemies in groups. In addition to style, The Witcher utilizes a unique <a data-ref-id=\"3015-18\" href=\"\/combo\/3015-18\/\" slug=\"combo\">combo system<\/a> that relies solely on timing. When Geralt gains a level in a certain style, he gains the ability to attack again if the player clicks at just the right time during a previous attack. Another important aspect of The Witcher's gameplay is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1233\" href=\"\/alchemy\/3015-1233\/\" slug=\"alchemy\">Alchemy<\/a>. The player can create potions with the various <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2743\" href=\"\/baking-ingredients\/3055-2743\/\" slug=\"baking-ingredients\">ingredients<\/a> at his disposal. Alchemy ingredients can be obtained from herbs or purchased from merchants. Some <a data-ref-id=\"3055-79\" href=\"\/potion\/3055-79\/\" slug=\"potion\">potions<\/a> will increase <a data-ref-id=\"3015-130\" href=\"\/health\/3015-130\/\" slug=\"health\">health<\/a> or provide faster <a data-ref-id=\"3015-83\" href=\"\/regenerating-health\/3015-83\/\" slug=\"regenerating-health\">regeneration of health<\/a>, while some potions will slow down the enemies. Others still will enable Geralt to see in the dark and many more. Along with traditional story elements, the Witcher features <a data-ref-id=\"3015-77\" href=\"\/dialogue-trees\/3015-77\/\" slug=\"dialogue-trees\">nonlinear dialogue<\/a> in which you may choose certain parts of your character's words which may or may not have consequences later on.<\/p><h2>Alchemy<\/h2><p style=\"\">The alchemy system in The Witcher is fleshed out, when compared to other modern RPG's. Since Witcher's are known for their wide use of potions, the player should have at least basic knowledge of alchemy to fully utilize Geralt's abilities. Every potion Geralt can create has a formula that Geralt must know beforehand. Each formula requires a base, and then a proportion of certain substances.<\/p><h3>Bases<\/h3><p style=\"\">Each formula has a base. The base required is different for what Geralt is making. For Potions, Geralt requires an alcohol base. For an Oil (such as a blade coating), Geralt requires a grease base. Finally, for a Bomb, Geralt requires a powder base.<\/p><h3>Substances<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are six main substances in the game: Vitriol, Rebis, Aether, Quebrith, Hydragenum, and Vermilion. Any ingredient found in the world contains one of these substances.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are also three secondary substances, they are: Albedo, Nigredo, and Rubedo. These secondary substances add benefits to the formula that is being conjured. If every ingredient in the formula has a consistent secondary substance, then the formula will receive a bonus, known as a dominance.<\/p><p style=\"\">Albedo Dominance - Reduces toxicity of consumed potions, lasts 1 hour.<\/p><p style=\"\">Nigredo Dominance - Increases damage inflicted by 20%, lasts 4 hours.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rubedo Dominance - Accelerate regeneration of vitality, lasts 4 hours.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Example:<\/b> If the player wanted to make a potion which required 1 vitriol, 2 rebis, and 1 aether ingredient, the potion can be made in a number of ways. If the ingredients chosen do not have secondary substances, or if they don't have matching substances then the potion will be standard, and will have no dominance. However, if the ingredients chosen each have a secondary substance of albedo, then the potion will end up having albedo dominance.<\/p><p style=\"\">Standard Potion= 1 Vitrio 2 Rebis 1 Aether<\/p><p style=\"\">Albedo Dominance Potion= 1 Vitrio (albedo) 1 Rebis (albedo) 1 Rebis (albedo) 1 Aether (albedo)<\/p><p style=\"\">Each ingredient needs to have the second substance for the benefit to be gained. There are three kinds of ingredients in the game: Herbs, Minerals, and Skinnable items. Below are charts of all the ingredients with their respective substance(s).<\/p><h3>Herbs in the Game<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Vitriol<\/th><th>Rebis<\/th><th>Aether<\/th><th>Quebrith<\/th><th>Hydragenum<\/th><th>Vermilion<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Albedo<\/b><\/td><td>White Myrtle Petals<\/td><td><\/td><td>Berbercane Fruit<\/td><td>Honeysuckle<br\/>Verbena<\/td><td>Wolf's Aloe Leaves<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Nigredo<\/b><\/td><td>Crow's Eye<\/td><td>Celandine<br\/>Han<\/td><td>Ginatia Petals<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Bryonia<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Rubedo<\/b><\/td><td>Hellebore Petals<br\/>Sewant Mushroom<\/td><td>Green Mold<\/td><td><\/td><td>Balisse Fruit<br\/>Fool's Parsley Leaves<\/td><td>Beggartick Blossoms<\/td><td>Feainnewedd<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>No Second Substance<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Minerals in the Game<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Vitriol<\/th><th>Rebis<\/th><th>Aether<\/th><th>Quebrith<\/th><th>Hydragenum<\/th><th>Vermilion<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Albedo<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Nigredo<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Quick Silver Solution<\/td><td>Ducal Water<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rubedo<\/td><td>Calcium Equum<\/td><td>Lunar Shards<\/td><td>Powdered Pearl<\/td><td>Optima Mater<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>No Second Substance<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td>White Stone<\/td><td><\/td><td>Sulfer<\/td><td>Fifth Essence<\/td><td>Phosphorus<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Skinnable Items in the Game<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Vitriol<\/th><th>Rebis<\/th><th>Aether<\/th><th>Quebrith<\/th><th>Hydragenum<\/th><th>Vermilion<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Albedo<\/b><\/td><td>Echinops Rootstock<\/td><td>Wing Membrane<\/td><td>Drowner Brain Tissue<\/td><td>Vodyanoi Bladder<\/td><td>Ectoplasm<\/td><td>Bloedzuiger Blood<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Nigredo<\/b><\/td><td>Ghoul Blood<br\/>Ginatz's Acid<\/td><td>Cemetaur Jaw<br\/>Stones of Ys<\/td><td>Drowned Dead Tongue<\/td><td>Alghoul Marrow<br\/>Garkain Saliva<\/td><td>Cockatrice Eye<\/td><td>Venom Glands<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Rubedo<\/b><\/td><td>Archespore Juice<br\/>Bruxa Blood<\/td><td>Beast Liver<\/td><td>Alp Fangs<\/td><td>Graveir Bone<br\/>Kikimore Claw<\/td><td>Pituitary Gland<\/td><td>Devourer Teeth<br\/>Pyrite<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>No Second Substance<\/b><\/td><td>Beast Fangs<br\/>Shimmering Dust<br\/>White Vinegar<\/td><td>Cadaverine<br\/>Death Dust<\/td><td>Cockatrice Feather<br\/>Naezan Salts<br\/>Spores<\/td><td>Abomination Lymph<br\/>Shadow Dust<\/td><td>Albar's Crystals<br\/>Mutagen<br\/>Tendons<br\/>Vodyanoi scales<\/td><td>Toxin<br\/>Tracheae<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p style=\"\">Below is a list of all the Formulae in the Game<\/p><h3>Potions<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Name<\/th><th>Ingredients<\/th><th>Effect<\/th><th>Duration<\/th><th>Toxicity<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Bindweed<\/td><td>1 Aether, 1 Quebrith, 1 Vermilion<\/td><td>Increases resistance to acid and acid-based poisons. <i>Acid resistance increased by 70%.<\/i><\/td><td>8 hours<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Black Blood<\/td><td>3 Vitriol, 1 Rebis, 1 Aether<\/td><td>Turns imbiber's blood into posion; blood becomes lethal to monsters which drink it. <i>Monsters feeding on Geralt die immediately.<\/i><\/td><td>8 hours<\/td><td>High<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blizzard<\/td><td>2 Vitriol, 2 Rebis<\/td><td>Boosts reflexes and reaction time, improving chance of parrying and evading attacks. <i>Dodge Efficiency increased by 50%; Parry Efficiency increased by 50%.<\/i><\/td><td>20 minutes<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cat<\/td><td>1 Rebis, 2 Quebrith<\/td><td>Grants vision in total darkness. <i>Seeing in the dark.<\/i><\/td><td>8 hours<\/td><td>Low<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>De Vries' Extra<\/td><td>1 Rebis, 1 Aether, 2 Quebrith, 1 Hydragenum<\/td><td>Makes hidden opponents visible. <i>Advanced night vision; Ability to detect invisible beings; Ability to see through walls.<\/i><\/td><td>1 hour<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fisstech<\/td><td>1 Rebis, 3 Hydragenum, 1 Vermilion<\/td><td>A strong drug with a long duration; can be sold for 20 gold. <i>Upon consumption - Pass out instantly.<\/i><\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full Moon<\/td><td>1 Quebrith, 2 Hydragenum, 2 Vermilion<\/td><td>Greatly increases maximum Vitality. <i>Maximum Vitality doubled.<\/i><\/td><td>8 hours<\/td><td>High<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Golden Oriole<\/td><td>2 Vitriol, 2 Aether<\/td><td>Increases resistance to poison.

He finds a small camp near the stronghold where he meets a nobleman and a sorceress Sabrina Glevissig. They came here to find Deidre, a young woman, who is staying in the witchers' stronghold. She is Eskel's surprise child, born on the Black Sun (ancient prophecy says that such children would ruin the World). It turns out that the nobleman is her brother, who wants to make sure she will not have the crown. Sorceress Sabrina wants to kill Deidre and examine her body to find out the truth about the Black Sun curse. Geralt has to decide whether to defend the girl or stay neutral.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Side Effects<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Dandelion gets into trouble in Vizima. Geralt has to collect a certain amount of money to buy him out and pay for his excesses. He collects the money by completing various tasks. The player can join effects of one task with another. For example: in a fistfight competition he can win cash or a bottle of alcohol. If he chooses to take the booze, he can use it to get one bandit drunk. Then he will give Geralt a key to a chest with loot. The mood of the story is similar to Dandelion's incidents with Vespula and Bibervelt's economics.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\"

href=\"\/bionic-commando\/3030-7860\/\" slug=\"bionic-commando\"> NES classic of the same name<\/a>. The game was developed by now defunct GRIN, who also recently helmed the updated remake of the NES game titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20483\" href=\"\/bionic-commando-rearmed\/3030-20483\/\" slug=\"bionic-commando-rearmed\"> Bionic Commando Rearmed<\/a>. The main focus of the game is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-124\" href=\"\/nathan-rad-spencer\/3005-124\/\" slug=\"nathan-rad-spencer\"> Nathan \"RAD\" Spencer<\/a>'s (the protagonist) <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1263\" href=\"\/bionic-arm\/3055-1263\/\" slug=\"bionic-arm\"> bionic arm<\/a> which is used both as means for transportation by swinging and climbing but also as a weapon. Bionic Commando features linear environments designed with the arm's swinging mechanic in mind. To make better use of the bionic arm it's functions have increased significantly compared to the original game.<\/p><p style=\"\">While primarily designed as a single player game, it includes an elaborate 10 player multiplayer component that differentiates itself from other games by including the swinging mechanic within the game's 16 included maps.<\/p><h2><b>Plot<\/b><\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/371858-189368_9_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-371858\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/371858-189368_9_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-371858\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3699\/371858-189368_9_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Nathan in action.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Bionic Commando takes place 10 years after the classic Bionic Commando for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\" slug=\"nes\"> NES<\/a> and a few years after the weekly updated comic book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bioniccommando.com\/us\/comics\/view\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bionic Commando: Chain of Command<\/a>. We find series protagonist Nathan \"RAD\" Spencer (voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-82285\" href=\"\/mike-patton\/3040-82285\/\" slug=\"mike-patton\"> Mike Patton<\/a>) as a government operative working in a city called Ascension City, where he is betrayed by the government, separated from his bionic arm and set for execution. On the day of his execution, a massive bomb explodes in Ascension City, unleashing an earthquake along with a radioactive shock wave that destroys the city and wipes out its population. The city is under threat of an invasion from a terrorist group called BioReign, bionically enhanced individuals that were once part of the Federal States Of America.<\/p><p style=\"\">The government decided that the bionic technology was too dangerous to control and issued the Bionic Purge, shutting down all military programs that issued soldiers with bionics. Additionally, the purge required existing bionic soldiers to remove their enhancements. Instead of losing their limbs, many soldiers became fugitives and joined the mysterious terrorist organization BioReign. The government decides to release Nathan \"RAD\" Spencer from his death sentence to investigate the group and put a stop to them. While Spencer has no motive to help the people who imprisoned him, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-52\" href=\"\/super-joe\/3005-52\/\" slug=\"super-joe\"> Joseph \" Super Joe\" Gibson<\/a> exchanges information about Spencer's missing wife, Emily, for full cooperation.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the beginning of the game, the motive and groups behind the destruction of Ascension City are unknown to Super Joe and the F.S.A., though the terrorist group BioReign is held in high suspicion. Agreeing to help the F.S.A. with an investigation, Spencer is launched into the heart of the city separate from his bionic arm. After finding his arm and putting it on, he dives into the city to investigate the cause of the explosion. A few encounters with hostile combatants have reaffirmed previous suspicions, and Spencer's investigation quickly turns into a single-man operation against a bionically-enhanced army.<\/p><p style=\"\">Throughout the game, Spencer finds a large number of relays that provide a few pieces of the game's backstory as well as profile information on Nathan Spencer. Beyond disabling minefields, hacking relays also allow Super Joe and the government to keep an eye on Spencer's current position. Spencer is reluctant to the idea, but revealing his current position would help the government drop insertion pods with heavy-duty equipment (shotguns, grenade launchers, etc.). The thought additional equipment causes Spencer to quickly rescind his previous statements.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/1063530-mag2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1063530\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/1063530-mag2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1063530\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6384\/1063530-mag2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Jayne \"Mag\" Magdalene<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Along the way, Spencer runs into <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10904\" href=\"\/jayne-mag-magdalene\/3005-10904\/\" slug=\"jayne-mag-magdalene\"> Jayne \"Mag\" Magdalene<\/a>, another bionic soldier whose enhancement is bionic leggings. Their brief encounter shows that Mag has defected to BioReign's side, though their reunion is cut off by the shot of a mysterious sniper sent to watch over Spencer. Then, he is given task of finding a crashed F.S.A. plane in hopes of recovering its video data. After recovering the data, navigating to the top of the F.S.A. and uploading the video, he engages in combat against a Buraq helicopter. Successful in his fight, Spencer jumps off the building and into the city's underground tunnels.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the middle of his tunnel excursion, Spencer is given the new task of retrieving an item known as the Carrion Device inside the Federal Archives Building. The Carrion Device, an important part of Project Vulture, was a secret government project created as a countermeasure against bionic technology, should the time ever come to use it. However, the decoded video data retrieved from the crashed F.S.A. plane have shown BioReign's interest in the device. Despite the Secretary of Defense's hatred of bionically-enhanced people, he has no choice but to entrust the location and care of the device to Spencer, who quickly races to its hiding spot. Unfortunately, his arrival at the Federal Archives Building is also met with BioReign's arrival. After disposing of all the soldiers, he secures the device and heads into the underground tunnels once again.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/724531-48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-724531\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/724531-48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-724531\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/669\/724531-48.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Mohole<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">This time, Spencer comes across the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12394\" href=\"\/the-mohole\/3005-12394\/\" slug=\"the-mohole\"> Mohole<\/a>, a mechanical worm responsible for digging the tunnels beneath Ascension City for BioReign. After emerging from the ground, he engages in a grueling fight with the Mohole in a vacant parking lot. Spencer eventually wins and gains access to yet another tunnel leading to Port Anderson, the evacuation spot for both the Carrion Device and himself. Yet, Port Anderson proves to be a tricky endeavor for the bionic commando; among the thunderstorm and night, he also has to contend with numerous BioReign operatives and improved versions of Biomechs. Spencer tries to keep contact with Super Joe only to receive static on the other end, supposedly due to interference by the lightning.<\/p><p style=\"\">Eventually, Spencer reaches Super Joe and proceeds to hand over the device. In another unfortunate turn of events, it ends up that Super Joe has been collaborating with BioReign from the start. Additionally, BioReign is also led by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6443\" href=\"\/gottfried-groeder\/3005-6443\/\" slug=\"gottfried-groeder\"> Gottfried Groeder<\/a>, who supposedly died during the crash of the Albatross ten years ago. After taking the device, Super Joe and Groeder attempt to dispose of Spencer, hold Mag captive and head off to activate Project Vulture. Though Spencer would not be easily killed off, as he manages to stealthily land atop one of the enemy's Buraq helicopters. He skillfully traverses the Buraq armada and made his way into the helicopter that housed Super Joe. Despite all this, Spencer abandons his chance to get the Carrion Device as Mag falls out of the helicopter and he decides to jump after her.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/1063533-superjoe1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1063533\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/1063533-superjoe1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1063533\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6384\/1063533-superjoe1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Joseph \"Super Joe\" Gibson<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The daredevil jump lands them in a crevice and in the wake of the Constructor, BioReign's transportable headquarters. Aware the final battle is near, the mysterious sniper from before comes forth as a man only known as Silver. After exchanging very few words, Spencer leaves Mag and Silver behind and finds a way into the Constructor. There, he disables the cooling system and encounters Groeder for a nostalgic showdown; Spencer disposes Groeder and heads to the site of Project Vulture to stop Super Joe. At the site of a former T.A.S.C. lab, Spencer learns that his wife was used as a catalyst for his arm; Super Joe explains that for a long time scientists have tried to get machine that emulate humans, but the success of his bionics program stemmed from making humans that emulate machines.<\/p><p style=\"\">Prior to the activation of Project Vulture, Super Joe kills Mag and takes flight using a bionic suit with an army of Vultures following behind. Spencer latches onto one of the Vultures and pursues his former ally into the sky. After disposing of a few Vultures, he encounters Super Joe and kills him, thus disabling the entirety of Project Vulture. With nothing to latch his arm onto, Spencer falls from the sky and the game ends with no finite conclusion.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1570\/624812-bc01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624812\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1570\/624812-bc01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624812\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1570\/624812-bc01.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Swinging.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game's core contrivance is the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1263\" href=\"\/bionic-arm\/3055-1263\/\" slug=\"bionic-arm\"> bionic arm<\/a> (also referred to as the wire, the cable or the hook). The skillful use of the arm has repeatedly been emphasized by the developer as the game's primary differentiators from other action adventure titles. Players can use it to get to high places that would otherwise be impossible to reach by grappling and jumping off surfaces. It can also be used for lateral movement by swinging. By doing so, players can gain a lot of distance by never touching the ground. Much like the NES title, management of stable ground-based gunplay with dramatically lowered mobility is a must. Strategic movement is needed to gain the drop on the enemy and maintain an advantage. Through effective use of the environment, the bionic arm may be used to throw large objects at enemies, take cover on the sides of buildings or kite enemies for an effortless kill.<\/p><p style=\"\">The arm utilizes a separate, partially automated aiming reticule that snaps along the vertical axis based on the player's current trajectory and aiming direction. Players pull a left shoulder button to fire the arm and release the button to let go of whatever the arm has latched onto. Skillful timing is an important skill for players to master, and HUD elements indicate the optimal release time to maximize forward momentum.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/371851-189368_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-371851\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/371851-189368_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-371851\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3699\/371851-189368_2_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>More swinging.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The arm can also be used as a weapon by hooking to enemies and zip kicking into them, the player also has the option to throw people up in the sky and shoot them in mid air. Like the top-down stages in the original NES game, the player is able to throw the bionic arm in a 360 degree circle and knock down multiple enemies at once. Most of the abilities are taught during the game's opening tutorial, but all of them are unlocked at later points in the game. The reasoning behind the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-57\" href=\"\/abilitease\/3015-57\/\" slug=\"abilitease\"> abilitease<\/a> is that bionics \"take time to sync with the bearer\". Later in the game, an adrenaline meter is unlocked to provide instant kills and enhanced versions of previous techniques.<\/p><p style=\"\">Bionic Commando plays like most third-person shooters in that there's a third-person camera for shooting from the hip. By clicking the right analog stick, there's also an over-the-shoulder angle for improved accuracy. Commentary on Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast suggests the game may have a novel mechanic in place for effectively targeting and shooting at enemies in mid-air while still maintaining separate control of the swing; though in-game evidence does not seem to exist.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/1063557-bcmultiplayer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1063557\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/1063557-bcmultiplayer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1063557\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6384\/1063557-bcmultiplayer.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Multiplayer mode in action.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Designed by a separate GRIN team than the one responsible for the single player component, the game's multiplayer will support up to 8 players in the traditional modes of online play (deathmatch, capture the flag, and team deathmatch). It has been revealed that the bionic arm will be limited compared to its singleplayer counterpart, but that the swinging mechanic will be in place. Players will be able to attach it to both teammates and enemies as well as the environment. Zip kicks and heavy punches are still present, but throwing and kiting remain absent in the multiplayer mode. Players accumulate experience points from defeating other players, which only boost the player's current position on the leaderboards. Currently, there are no plans to correlate the experience points with a leveling system.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are no customizable character options and joining a game will only randomize the color of the player's character. Even though the multiplayer mode was met with some poor reception due to an Xbox Live demo, it has been formally recognized by Major League Gaming. Numerous glitches such as rapid pistol fire and higher-damage shotgun blasts still plague the system and there are no plans for a patch at this time.<\/p><h2>Bionic Commando: Rearmed Connectivity<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/924890-bionic_commando_rearmed_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924890\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/924890-bionic_commando_rearmed_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924890\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7465\/924890-bionic_commando_rearmed_02.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>BC: Rearmed, a remake of the NES game.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Owners of the downloadable title <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20483\" href=\"\/bionic-commando-rearmed\/3030-20483\/\" slug=\"bionic-commando-rearmed\"> Bionic Commando: Rearmed<\/a> will find certain features unlocked in their copy of Bionic Commando.

This amalgam of western and Japanese design philosophies is a first for Capcom Japan, and has been seen by some as somewhat of a risky venture. Poor sales may cause the company to reconsider its strategy, though Ben Judd has constantly reassured fans that most mistakes have been taken into consideration. In the future, Capcom hopes that the development of Bionic Commando will help provide better quality for titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25187\" href=\"\/dead-rising-2\/3030-25187\/\" slug=\"dead-rising-2\"> Dead Rising 2<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Creative director at GRIN, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-66261\" href=\"\/ulf-andersson\/3040-66261\/\" slug=\"ulf-andersson\"> Ulf Andersson<\/a>, has described designing the bionic arm mechanic and handling the repercussions of giving players complete freedom of mobility the biggest hurdles encountered during development.<\/p><h3>Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast<\/h3><p style=\"\">While having virtually nothing to do with the game itself, Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast was a large step for a company as tight-knit as Capcom Japan.

While having Bionic Commando in its name, the podcast served more as look into Japanese game development and its contrast with western development. The bi-weekly show was popular for its humorous banter, hard-hitting questions against its own employees and nonsensical censorship. It was originally intended as an effort to get the word out via community efforts instead of through conventional ad campaigns; Gearoid Reidy has stated that the podcast may not have done its job while Ben Judd remains optimistic.<\/p><p style=\"\">Numerous bits of trivia have spilled out of the podcast, including the numerous voices behind the Phoenix Wright and Onimusha series. On May 27th, 2009, the final episode of the podcast was released ending nearly two years after its conception. Currently, future plans will be unveiled on the Capcom Unity blog at some point.<\/p><h2>Critical Reception\/Sales<\/h2><p style=\"\">Even though the game was distinctly crafted for a western audience, Bionic Commando was met with reception ranging anywhere from poor to average when released in North America. The scores also corresponded to the sales numbers, as the game sold less than 27,000 units across both platforms during its first month on shelves. Sales projections from Capcom in 2008 predicted that the game would sell over one million units throughout the year. Strangely enough, the retail game sold roughly 100,000 units less than its downloadable counterpart, Bionic Commando: Rearmed. Ben Judd took Rearmed's sales as a point of optimism, saying that retail games ultimately sell much more than downloadable games.<\/p><p style=\"\">Despite repeated worry over reception in Japan, Bionic Commando managed to get a score of 34\/40 in Famitsu, boosting the potential for an ironically better performance overseas and netting itself a gold award. However, it's first week in Japan was met with sales totaling under 10,000 units. The PS3 version debuted as the number one Gaijin game for the week of June 28th, 2009 to July 4th, 2009 and number 26 on the overall sales chart for the week (the 360 version did worse at number three on the Gaijin list and number 31 on the overall sales chart). Plans for a sequel are looking unlikely at this point.<\/p><p style=\"\">The most up-to-date sales data of this game is a total of 550,000 copies shipped, though amount of units sold still remains a mystery. Despite a great performance by other Capcom titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\" href=\"\/resident-evil-5\/3030-20569\/\" slug=\"resident-evil-5\"> Resident Evil 5<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\" href=\"\/street-fighter-iv\/3030-20456\/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iv\"> Street Fighter IV<\/a> earlier in the year, Bionic Commando is heavily regarded as a flop. Today, the game is ridiculed by some critics because of its far-fetched ending.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p style=\"\">On July 28th, 2009, the official soundtrack to Bionic Commando was distributed as a retail package via Sumthing Else Music Works and as a digital download through Sumthing Digital and the iTunes store. The soundtrack features 20 tracks from the game and excludes pieces such as sound effects or fanfares typical with some game's soundtrack release. Simon Viklund, Jamie Christopherson, Jonatan Crafoord, Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg and Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonzalez Castro are the credited artists on the track listing.<\/p><h3>Track Listing<\/h3><p style=\"\">01 \"Main Theme\" (Jamie Christoperson, Junko Tamiya)<\/p><p style=\"\">02 \"Ascension City Awakening\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">03 \"Desertion\" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya)<\/p><p style=\"\">04 \"Flooded\" (Jonatan Crafoord)<\/p><p style=\"\">05 \"Fight Unlimited\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">06 \"Enhanced Tunnel Vision (Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">07 \"Groder's Anthem\" (Jamie Christopherson, Junko Tamiya)<\/p><p style=\"\">08 \"Hero of the Past\" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya)<\/p><p style=\"\">09 \"The Laws of Nature\" (Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">10 \"From Darkness to Wonder\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">11 \"From Trash Till Dawn\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">12 \"Project Vulture\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">13 \"Preparations\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg, Simon Viklund)<\/p><p style=\"\">14 \"The Molhole\" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya)<\/p><p style=\"\">15 \"Road to Ascension\" (Jamie Christopherson)<\/p><p style=\"\">16 \"Hunters of the FSA\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">17 \"The Gauntlet\" (Jamie Christopherson)<\/p><p style=\"\">18 \"Piano Theme\" (Junko Tamiya, Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonzalez Castro)<\/p><p style=\"\">19 \"Beyond Dark Skies\" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)<\/p><p style=\"\">20 \"Adaigo\" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya)<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>The reveal of Nathan's wife, Emily, as the bionic arm caused a lot of humorous results.

Your Sims can roam outside of their home with no loading times. They can stroll downtown to hang out with friends, meet someone new at the park, or run into colleagues on the street. New community buildings are available to let your Sim run wild, socialize, work, and play. Easy-to-use design tools allow for unlimited customization to make truly individual Sims. Determine your Sims\u2019 shape and size, from thin to full-figured to muscular\u2014and everything in between. <i>The Sims 3<\/i> offers much more in the way of customizing the Sims that live in the neighborhood and also the buildings and places. Thanks to the new smarter AI, Sims will know when to do chores, activities, socializing and how long they should do them for.<\/p><h2>Sunset Valley<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>The Sims 3<\/i> neighborhood is now completely seamless. There are no longer multiple neighborhoods such as Downtown, Vacation, and so on. Load times when moving around the neighborhood has been eliminated so the whole town can be explored including Neighbors, Shops and Recreation without a hitch. There are close to 90 houses in the town, each with its own family. At release, the game includes one neighborhood, but the developers have released a tool to add more neighborhoods.<\/p><h3>Neighborhood Features<\/h3><ul><li>Everyone in the town will age together.<\/li><li>Trees and shrubs sway in the breeze.<\/li><li>The town is fully customizable and allows you to remove and change lots and Sims.<\/li><li>\"Map Tags\" float over areas to allow a quick way to find your way around.<\/li><li>Sims can move nearer to their place of work to reduce traveling time.<\/li><li>Land values are not just based on size, but now include location.<\/li><li>You are able to zoom out to see the entire neighborhood or zoom in to a see a single Sim.<\/li><li>Move houses to bigger or smaller lot sizes.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Sims<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5207\/226614-s3_cas_socialite_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226614\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5207\/226614-s3_cas_socialite_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-226614\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/5207\/226614-s3_cas_socialite_1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>An example of a Sim.  <\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Sims themselves have been completely changed from previous games. Now you are able to create realistic Sims with distinctive personalities. Select from dozens of personality traits and combine them in fun ways. The combination of traits you choose help shape the behavior of your Sims and how they interact with other Sims. Your Sims now have a very basic set of every day needs and they are more complex individuals with unique personalities. There will no longer be \"happy\" or \"sad\", or even \"furious,\" Sims now have a new range of Emotions which they will follow, allowing them to express themselves even more. The concept of a mood bar in the game has been replaced with a set of icons called moodlets that show how your Sims feel. Moodlets will stay with your Sim and the duration will be set by a number of factors, including severity and Sims' disposition. Special moods such as embarrassed or depressed are all part of the moodlets system.<\/p><p style=\"\">Sims now have dreams and traits. Dreams are desires of your Sim that can include wanting to talk to another Sim, get a new career, have a baby and much more. You can decide then to turn it into a Promise. Ignoring a Dream is okay, but ignoring a Promise gives you negative repercussions. There will be around 80 different types of traits to choose from and each Sim will have a total of 5 once they reach the young adult life stage. These Traits will affect how a Sim behaves towards others and affects their moods, like the mood of a Sim that enjoys the outdoors will rise when he\/she is outside. There will be 7 age groups: Baby, Toddler, Child, Teenager, Young Adult, Adult, and Elder. Every career has its own building in the neighborhood. Advancing in a career is changed as it depends on skills, personality, relationship with colleagues\/boss and even certain goals that have to be fulfilled. Sims can take part-time jobs. Besides the newspaper, you can also apply for a job at the specific career building.<\/p><p style=\"\">The job system has also received an overhaul. Rather than the Sims simply disappearing for a few hours before coming home, they will actually physically go to a building in the city to work. For example, if a Sim is a musician, they will travel to the theater for work. While they are working, players are able dictate how they work, with options ranging from \"Take It Easy\" to \"Work Hard\" (which tires them out and causes stress but gets more stuff done). Jobs can also have specific options, such as the musician career path having the option to chill with your band mates or study music theory.<\/p><h3>Keeping Sims Fulfilled<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once you created your Sims on PS3, DS, Wii, XBOX 360, PC or Mac, you can either make Sims happy (Fulfilled) or Unhappy (Unfulfilled). Although you earn more experience if they are fulfilled in even the simplest way. To Do: just look at your Sim's needs and dreams and complete them.<\/p><h3>Sims Features<\/h3><ul><li>There are only 6 needs: Energy, Bladder, Fun, Hunger, Social, Hygiene.<\/li><li>Sims have certain skills like cooking or fishing.<\/li><li>Hair will not grow but you can 'paint' certain parts of the hair.<\/li><li>They will look after themselves better.<\/li><li>Instead of fixed interaction (like Talk or Joke), the options are filtered based on your current Mood or your Traits.<\/li><li>Sims still spin around to change clothes.<\/li><li>Sims have likes and dislikes to certain foods, colors, music and much more.<\/li><li>Sims will now focus on many new skills, skills will not be static as in The Sims 2.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Customization<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4371\/282003-image002_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-282003\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4371\/282003-image002_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-282003\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/4371\/282003-image002_noscale.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Add patterns and colors to almost everything in the game<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Sims and the neighborhood are more customizable than ever before and new and improved tools will be provided to help you create everything you want. Build your dream house or design the ultimate home. Customize everything from floors to flowers, shirts to sofas, wallpaper to window shades. It\u2019s fun and easy to change colors and patterns giving you endless personalization options. You can also populate your Sims\u2019 neighborhood with pre-designed buildings and furnishings. Create-A-Sim has also been vastly improved and will allow you to really make the sims you create unique. There are now sliders for weight and fitness. Sims that you created fat can become thin by exercising, and thin created people get fat by eating a lot. Sims no longer have to have shoes that are fixed to the outfit, as with <i>The Sims 2.<\/i> These are now separate and can be chosen individually. You can choose a Sims' favorite color, music type, food, etc. One of the most exciting features is now the ability to change voice and even pitch, so your Sim can sound unique and will be recognizable by just listening to them talk.<\/p><p style=\"\">Another great addition to the build tools is the ability to move objects 360 degrees and without a grid. You can now also position stuff on counters or desktops as long as the objects aren't overlapping. There will be a grid available if you need help placing objects, but it will be much smaller. You will be able to center a 3 tile couch to a 2 tile TV set.<\/p><h3>Customization Features<\/h3><ul><li>You can choose specific Asian and African models.<\/li><li>Shoes are separate and you can also choose barefoot or wear socks.<\/li><li>Body can be shaped just like the faces are able to.<\/li><li>Adult now considered more 'middle aged' and includes wrinkles.<\/li><li>Use your own patterns\/colors and then apply it to anything through a drag-and-drop interface.<\/li><li>Buy an empty bookcase and then buy and place books in it.<\/li><li>Table and chairs link and can move as 1 object (same with beds and end tables).<\/li><li>You can make a certain stair wider (up to 4 tiles wide) with a slider.<\/li><li>You are able to build 5 stories high.<\/li><li>You can pick up items (garbage, books,etc.) yourself with a Hand cursor.<\/li><\/ul><h2>The Sims 3 Online Store<\/h2><p style=\"\">EA (Electronic Arts) have created a new unique \"The Sims 3 Store\" where you can shop online for interesting items for the game. The items on The Store are much different to regular items found in Build\/Buy Mode (In Gameplay). Purchasing the items, you will be paying by Sim Points, exclusive to the Store. However, some items are Free of Charge such as, Registration Rewards. When you Register The Sims 3, you will be given 1000 Sim Points to freely spend, but on other Expansion Packs you will receive rewards (Exclusive Registration Items)...<\/p><p style=\"\">Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/store.thesims3.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sims 3 Store<\/a><\/p><h3>The Exchange<\/h3><p style=\"\">The Exchange can be found on the console versions of the Sims 3.

For instance if you want to improve the cooking skills some of your options are watching a tv show about cooking, reading a cookbook, and actually practicing making meals. All of these skills will eventually rise if the Sim continually works on them and a scale from 1 to 10 represents where they currently fall within that skill. When a skill is complete, it will be highlighted green and considered 'mastered' in the Skill journal.<\/p><h2>Cheat Codes<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Sims franchise is notorious for including a bounty of cheat codes, and The Sims 3 is no different. The game includes many cheat codes that modify the game in some truly bizarre ways. Note that these codes should be used your own risk, some may harm game performance or stability.

Challenges can be broken down into 3 distinct categories: Life, Feats, and Collection. Life challenges are simple and usually require the Sim just to do one thing to complete it. An example of a life challenge is to start a painting or take a bubble bath. The Feats Challenges usually require more time and are longevity based. An example of a Feats challenge would be like that of improving a skill to level ten or watching TV for ten hours. The collection challenges require the Sim to complete all tasks in a set of items. These can range from reading all the books to catching all of the perfect fish in the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">For every challenge you complete, you gain points that can be used to buy things at the collection shop. The collection shop contains many varying sorts of items including clothes, furniture, and some of the karma powers are unlocked in the collection shop.

The Create-A-World tool (more frequently called CAW) can be used by players to create entirely new towns to explore, and these towns can be shared on the Sims 3 website. The second tool is the Create-A-Pattern tool (known as CAP) where players can make their own patterns that can be used on furnishings or clothing in the game. Both of these tools are fully supported by EA and are regularly updated along with the game itself.<\/p><h2>Xbox 360, PS3, DS, 3DS, and Wii releases<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5785\/1354014-580ts3consolecoupleretreat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1354014\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5785\/1354014-580ts3consolecoupleretreat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1354014\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/5785\/1354014-580ts3consolecoupleretreat.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Sims franchise has already generated $2.5 billion in revenue.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">EA lived up to last year's promise after releasing Sim's 3 for the PC and has officially announced the development of Sim 3 for consoles and handhelds this holiday season. The console versions will have several new features such as \"Karma Power\" which determines whether your Sim can get lucky in certain tasks or ultimately fail. The PS3 and 360 versions will feature Facebook connectivity to enable the sharing of achievements and trophies via wall posts, and the Wii version will get it's own beach town. The DS will introduce a brand new story mode, not seen previously in handheld Sims games. A 3DS version was also released, this version was similar to the iOS release with added 3D effects. The Sims 3 Pets was also released on The Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and Nintendo 3DS. The Xbox 360 version added Kinect support to the franchise.<\/p><h2>Karma Powers<\/h2><p style=\"\">Accumulating Karma in the Sims 3 can be done in two ways. Firstly, Karma is gained by completing the wishes your Sims desire. At midnight, Karma is also dispersed upon your Sims and the amount given is directly effected to whether or not the Sim used one of their Karma Powers earlier in the day. Karma Powers can be placed into two shades of categories: light(good) and dark(bad). Some of the powers are locked from the start and must be unlocked in the challenge shop.<\/p><p style=\"\">The following good Karma Powers are as follows:<\/p><ul><li><b>Instant Beauty<\/b>: Give any Sim in your household an instant makeover by taking him or her back to create a Sim!<\/li><li><b>Good Times<\/b>: Remove bad moodlets from everyone at the same time to put all your sims in a better mood!<\/li><li><b>Bless the Mess<\/b>: Instantly repair and clean anything broken, dirty, or messy!<\/li><li><b>Super Satisfy<\/b>: Satisfy any Sim by maximizing all of his or her needs at once!<\/li><li><b>Stroke of Genius<\/b>: Make any Sim learn skills at a supper-accelerated rate for a few hours!<\/li><li><b>Get Lucky<\/b>: Make any Sim super lucky in love, at work, at finding rare items and even catching fish!<\/li><li><b>Giant Jackpot<\/b>: Let any Sim hit the jackpot with free money from the heavens! Drop anywhere from 1000 Simoleans to 15 thousand Simoleans instantly!<\/li><li><b>Divine Intervention<\/b>: Bring any dead family member back to life! Use on their ghost.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The five bad karma powers are listed as follows:<\/p><ul><li><b>Cosmic Curse<\/b>: Lower any Sim's need to rock bottom instantly!<\/li><li><b>Fire Storm<\/b>: Rain fire and brimstone down on the world with a flaming meteorite shower!<\/li><li><b>Quake Maker<\/b>: Shake the world and watch things break and burn!<\/li><li><b>Poltergeists<\/b>: Haunt any house with these angry ghosts to scare the living daylights out of your Sims!<\/li><li><b>Epic Fail<\/b>: Make any Sim an epic failure in love, career, and even simple household tasks for a few hours!<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The Karma Powers 'Get Lucky', 'Giant Jackpot', 'Good Times', 'Stroke of Genius', 'Divine Intervention', and 'Fire Storm' must be unlocked before use.<\/p><h2>Achievements (PC)<\/h2><p style=\"\">Prior to the release of The Sims 3's expansion pack <a href=\"\/the-sims-3-showtime\/3030-37006\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37006\">Showtime<\/a>, the base game was updated to include achievements, in addition to Showtime's.

Godfather II is set in 1959 and has been expanded to take place over 3 cities: <a href=\"..\/..\/miami\/95-787\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miami<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/havana\/95-1142\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havana<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/new-york\/95-109\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York City<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the game you play as Dominic a young man in the employ of Aldo Trapini, the previous game's protagonist. When Aldo is shot and killed by Cuban revolutionaries, Michael Corleone charges you with taking over his role within the family and from there you must begin expanding the family's control of the crime world. In order to achieve this, you get tips and help from Frank Pentangeli, an old made man, to gather up a family and start taking over rackets and businesses. The game's story is loosely based on The Godfather: Part Two, the movie by <a href=\"\/francis-ford-coppola\/3040-17054\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-17054\">Francis Ford Coppola<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Single Player<\/h3><p style=\"\">The game play has a conquest like feel, in that the individual rackets in the city are controlled by rival families, and you are tasked with getting these rackets under the control of your family by intimidating them to pay for your protection. To do this you can send members of your gang to rival controlled territories to weaken them by doing things like bombing their buildings which outright destroys the racket for a period of time. You can also take out members of the rival family. If the family member is taken out, they can't defend their rackets or attack your rackets. Also, they won't be at their family's compound when you try to take their compound. Once they are weak enough, you can attack these rackets and try to defeat them and make them your own. Taking a territory doesn\u2019t guarantee its safety though, and you will have to hire guards in case someone tries to take a territory from you. Depending on number of the guards you set for your territories, they will cost you money and reduce your daily payout. When another family invades your rackets, you can either go and defend it by yourself or send one or two of your family members to defend the business, because usually, ordinary guards won't last long in a full scale attack. Taking over all the crime ring areas rewards you with a bonus like armored cars, brass knuckles, bullet proof vests, etc, depending on which one you take over. After taking over all rackets of a family, they will go defensive in their compounds. You can go there and destroy their compound with a bomb, and then, they're done for ever and the former compound is yours. As said before, rackets have related activities, and taking over a ring of rackets with the same activity will reward you with items and circumstances that reduces the game's difficulty. The crime rings are listed below:<\/p><ol><li>Gambling- Rewards incendiary ammo.<\/li><li>Arms Smuggling- Rewards increase of explosive carriage.<\/li><li>Diamond Smuggling- Rewards Bulletproof vest for your family and guards.<\/li><li>Chop Shop- Rewards armored car parked in front of them and every airport as well.<\/li><li>Adult Entertainment- Rewards reduce of Guard payout.<\/li><li>Prostitution- Rewards Brass Knuckles.<\/li><li>Drug- Double's the income cash from this ring.<\/li><li>Constructions- Your businesses will recover quickly.<\/li><li>Gun Running- Increases ammo capacity.<\/li><li>Extorting Business- 9 Shops including bars and electrical stores, only increases money.<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\">Families are listed below:<\/p><ol><li>Carmine Rosato Family- New York<\/li><li>Tony Rosato Family- New York and Miami<\/li><li>Mamango Family- Havana and Miami<\/li><li>Almeida- Havana and Miami<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\">There are other activities than racketeering as well. Some pedestrians will give you intel and money if you do them a \"Favor\". They can be burglary, murder, sabotage, and other crimes. Intel that they'll give you is a \"Kill condition\" for another family's made men. If you don't kill a made man with their special kill condition, they'll disappear from the map for a brief time, then return. They'll disappear for good if you follow the \"Kill Condition\" instructions sharply. For example, hitting them with a car or throwing them in a river. Other favors will give you money.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Black Hand controls make a return in this game, in which you use the triggers to grab your enemy and beat them with your fists, or environmental objects until they agree to cooperate with you. A new feature added to this section is \"Weak Point\". Every shopkeeper and business owner you're intimidating has a personal weak point witch you can discover and use to increase their payout. For example, some shopkeepers are afraid of physical attack, some will agree to cooperate with you after you smashed their goods or consumers and many other various weak points.<\/p><p style=\"\">This time around you will be able to create your own family. in order to expend your family, you should search cities for guys with a dollar icon over their head. Once you approach them, you can ask them about their specialties. There are six kind of made man you can hire:<\/p><ol><li>Demolition: Bomb experts. you can use them to rig cars and bring rackets and compounds down.<\/li><li>Arsonist: You can use them to ignite a place.<\/li><li>Safe Cracker: They will open locks and safes for you.<\/li><li>Engineer: They can use tools and hardware to make your job easier, for example, cutting a fence to open up your way through them.<\/li><li>Buiser: Bull guys, they can be useful during a combat and they can kick down weak doors.<\/li><li>Medic: they can revive your family member defeated in a combat. otherwise, you have to do it yourself.<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\">Each class will help you during a battle and they won't be a weasel. They will talk to you and give you tips about things. Simultaneously, you can have three of your seven made men following you. You can use rest of them to defend your turf, as said before. You will be able to manage your criminal empire with \"The Don's View\" where you can see all the statuses of your crime rings, battles in progress, locations of your jobs, and contacts. You can decide actively which crime ring to go after, hire guards for your critical rackets, deploy your made men, and finally place hits on your rival families. Don's View is a three dimensional map that has your interest points marked in it. Also, you can set a waypoint in it. When you're in the Don's View, by pressing a button, you will be taken to your territory console. You can see your family tree in there, using it to promote, discard or upgrade a made man. (You can upgrade your own skills too). Skills that can be upgraded are various, Health, Survival, Speciality upgrade, Aim Accuracy, etc. You can see another family's tree as well. Once you killed a made man from that family, their picture on the tree will be covered with blood, indicating that they're finished. From Don's View, you can view the active favors. Favors are marked with a lip-lop shaped circle on the map. You can access you inventory, and see where the \"Corrupt Officials\" are. Corrupt officials are officials that will help you if you do a favor for them. For example, a cop will call back his friends if you smash a shop for him, a construction site boss will send his workers to rebuild your damaged business. You can travel between the cities by airplane and in each of them, you can access another city through Don's View. \"The Don's View\" gives the game an RTS feel in some ways.<\/p><p style=\"\">You can simultaneously carry four kinds of weaponry. Three kind of explosives, including Dynamite, Cocktail Molotov, and Bomb. One melee weapon, like a pool cue, baseball bat, or a garrote wire for a stealth kill. There are also projectile weapons. Each type of projectile weapon has three tiers which upgrade your previous weapon of the same type. For instance, your default Tommy Gun can be upgraded by finding a MP38 which offers a better magazine size. These different weapons can only be found in certain places in the game world. Projectile weapons are:<\/p><ol><li>Pistol: Pistol (Level 1, Default), Silenced Pistol (Level 2, Florida- On table during your rescue mission for one of Hyman Roth's men), Delta M1911 Silenced (Level 3, Florida- Second Floor of Mangano Compound)<\/li><li>Magnum: .357 Magnum (Level 1, Default), .44 Magnum (Level 2, New York- Second Floor in Carmine Rosato's Compound), .501 Magnum Enforcer (Level 3, Cuba- Located inside Battaglia Quarry Chop Shop near Lighthouse)<\/li><li>Machine Gun: Tommy Gun (Level One, Default), MP38 (Level 2, Florida- Second Floor of the Granados Compound), Modified AK-47 (Level 3, Cuba- Battaglia Masonry, Go inside smaller room, turn left and climb down the ladder, then follow the tunnel underground)<\/li><li>Shotgun: Shotgun (Level 1, Default), Sawed-Off Shotgun (Level 2, New York- Use arsonist to burn bushes near Corleone Compound), Schofield Semi Auto (Level 3, Florida- Inside Global Storage Chop Shop on wall in the right side building)<\/li><li>Sniper Rifle: Sniper Rifle (Level 1, Default), Spitzer Centerfire (Level 2, Florida- On rooftop of Emilio's Packing Company, use engineer to cut fence), Vintovka SR-98 (Level 3, Cuba- On second floor of Almeida Compound)<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\">With these weapons you can also use brutal executions on enemies. These brutal executions provide a more graphic or gruesome way to kill your enemies. Just weaken the enemy substantially, but don't kill them. Go up to them and click in the right stick to use an execution on the enemy to kill them in a more gruesome way. Every type of weapon in the game has their own unique execution.<\/p><p style=\"\">Just like the original, you can drive vehicles in the game. The variety of the cars can't be compared to a game like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, but they're still away from being frustrating after a while, which was one of weak points in the original one. Controlling a car is much easier, and you can avoid damage easily because in corners, optionally you can make the car to turn by itself. (developers didn't mean that straightly, of course).<\/p><h3>Multiplayer<\/h3><p style=\"\">There will be an online option as well that will be able to support up to 16 players. In this mode, you will be playing as the made men. All the abilities you earned in single player will appear online with your made men. In return, rewards from online play called \"Honors\" can then be used to get more upgrades for your made men in single player like advanced weapon licenses and more powerful firearms. The online modes include <u><b>Team Deathmatch<\/b><\/u>, the bloodiest of the modes, <u><b>Fire starters<\/b><\/u>, focusing on setting the most fires and maintaining score multipliers with your arsonists, <u><b>Demolition Assault<\/b><\/u>, the most team centric mode where players have to destroy three enemy controlled points on the map using their demolition expert, and <u><b>Safe cracker<\/b><\/u>, used to control the most territory using the safe cracking specialist. After it's first day of release, EA patched the game with a new multiplayer mode called <u><b>Don Control<\/b><\/u> where up to 16 players wager money that they earned in the single player for the ultimate control. As a Don, players will compete to recruit members online and if you lose as the Don, your money in the single player campaign is wagered away and your single player empire is hurt.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\">The servers for the online multiplayer component of Godfather 2 were turned off on April 13th, 2012.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">Unlike the original game where the beginning scenes coincided with the beginning of The Godfather, the story of this sequel starts with the visit of Michael Corleone in Cuba unlike in the movie where the film begins with Michael Corleone's son's first Communion in Lake Tahoe. The game also never mentions the other half of the movie which documents the rise of Vito Corleone when he first comes to America. Michael and several other Dons are there in order to make a deal with an older gangster, Hyman Roth. Unlike the movie, the Cuban revolt begins to gain success faster than seen in the movie: the revolutionaries interrupt Roth's birthday and take over areas of the city. Dominic (the player), Michael and Aldo (the protagonist of the original game, now a don himself) have to make their way to the airport and fly back to New York City. Before they enter the airport, however, Aldo gets shot and immediately dies. On the plane ride back, Michael offers Dominic to take Aldo's place. With help from Frank Pentangeli, who currently runs Corleone's businesses and assets in New York while Michael is in Nevada, Dominic hires a soldier to become a made man and begins to take over the New York by weakening the other families.<\/p><p style=\"\">The first family you must take over is Carmine Rosato's family, who took over some of New York's territories after the death of Aldo. After taking over some of his territories, Carmine offers a sit down to make peace between your families. Dominic goes with Frank Pentangeli. Of course, the sit down is a trap and you are almost killed along with Frank. After Dominic escapes, he takes over the rest of Carmine's rackets in New York and takes down the Carmine Rosato Compound, thus eliminating the family.<\/p><p style=\"\">Dominic is then called down to Florida to meet with Hyman Roth. He asks you to rescue one of his men and after you do so, he gives you a safehouse in Florida. Dominic then battles against the Granados Family and Tony Rosato's Family, the brother of Carmine. After substantially weakening the two families and possibly destroying them, you are called back to New York by Michael. Unfortunately, there is a strike at the airport. There you meet Hyman Roth again, who introduces Dominic to Agent Henry Mitchell of the CIA who tells Dominic to kill the instigator of the strike, who he calls a Communist sympathizer. After you take him out, Dominic can finally travel to New York.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once in New York, Michael tells Dominic that the Corleone Family is under investigation by a Senate Committee and that they have a witness in Frank Pentangelli who survived the attack against him and now believes that Michael betrayed him. He then gives you Tom Hagen to be your Consigliere. Hagen then tasks you with getting a senator, Pat Geary, on your side. To do this, Dominic allow Geary access to one of the Corleone's brothels. When Geary is there, they make him believe that he killed one of the prostitutes. Once Geary is on your side, he informs Dominic of a new family in Miami called the Mangano family. Dominic initially starts an alliance with the Manganos, but once Dominic is attacked in his safehouse, he suspects the Mangano family is responsible. He attacks one of their warehouses and the Manganos break off the alliance, telling Michael that they were not behind the attack.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Dominic goes to war with the Manganos, he goes to Hyman Roth and Agent Mitchell to help him. They tell him that Dominic must go to Cuba to assassinate Fidel Castro in order for them to help in Dominic's war. Dominic goes down to Cuba and kills many of the government's dissidents to make them believe that he is on their side. After he is allowed in the presidential palace, he attempts to kill Fidel Castro with a sniper rifle. Unfortunately, he fails and an associate of Castro, Don Almeida tries to kill Dominic, but he escapes.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once back in New York, Michael must escort Vincenzo Pentangelli, Frank's brother who will try to influence Frank into not testifying, to Michael's trial before the Senate Committee. Unfortunately, he is kidnapped and Dominic rescues him. He brings him to the Senate Committee and gets Frank to not reveal secrets about the family. After the Committee, it is revealed that Roth and Mitchell have gone against the family and that Fredo has unwittingly betrayed Michael to Roth. Michael then tasks Dominic with taking out the rest of the families in the three cities and killing Agent Mitchell. After killing the rest of your enemies, you are then tasked by Michael to kill Roth who is returning to America through Florida's airport. Dominic fights through security and Roth's men to take him out. When he encounters Roth, Dominic demands to know why he betrayed them, to which Roth replies that \"This was the life we chose\". Dominic then takes out Roth and escapes the police to the former Mangano compound where Michael congratulates him and offers him one last task. The final cutscene of the game depicts Dominic assassinating Fredo while they are fishing on Lake Tahoe.<\/p><h2>System Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP SP2\/Vista<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Pentium 4 @ 2.8 GHz\/AMD Athlon64 3000+<\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB for XP\/2 GB for Vista<\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive:<\/strong> 9+ GB Free<\/li><li><strong>Video Memory:<\/strong> 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce 6800 or better\/ATI X1600 Pro or better<\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> DirectX Compatible<\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> 9.0c<\/li><\/ul><h3>Recommended<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP SP2\/Vista<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Athlon64 X2 235\/Intel Core 2 Duo processor Memory: 2 GB for XP\/4 GB for Vista<\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive:<\/strong> 9+ GB Free<\/li><li><strong>Video Memory:<\/strong> 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce 8500 or better\/ATI RADEON HD2400 Pro or better<\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> DirectX Compatible<\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> 9.0c<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1894710-box_gfather2.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1894710-box_gfather2.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1894710-box_gfather2.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1894710-box_gfather2.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1894710-box_gfather2.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1894710-box_gfather2.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1894710-box_gfather2.png"},"name":"The Godfather II"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><br\/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39552\/1059455-nfss04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1059455\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39552\/1059455-nfss04.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1059455\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/39552\/1059455-nfss04.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Shift's cockpit view.<\/figcaption><\/figure>The next instalment in the long-running <a data-ref-id=\"3025-483\" href=\"\/need-for-speed\/3025-483\/\" slug=\"need-for-speed\">   Need For Speed franchise<\/a> will be developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6578\" href=\"\/slightly-mad-studios\/3010-6578\/\" slug=\"slightly-mad-studios\">     Slightly Mad Studios<\/a> (formerly <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5328\" href=\"\/blimey-games-ltd\/3010-5328\/\" slug=\"blimey-games-ltd\">    Blimey!

When you first enter this \"story\" mode you will be put into a BMW M3 with no assists on and run a hot lap. Based on that hot lap the game will configure its settings and assists to fit your driving style for a well rounded experience. You will then race on the same track with the same car with your specific game adjustments. This race will determine your beginning currency for the game, however it will only be a difference of about 10,000 no matter what position you get.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2> <br\/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>OS: Windows XP (Service Pack 3) \/ Windows Vista (Service Pack 1) \/ Windows 7<\/li><li>CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.6 Ghz or faster<\/li><li>RAM: 1GB RAM (Windows XP) \/ 2 GB RAM (Windows Vista \/ Windows 7)<\/li><li>HDD: 6 GB free disk space<\/li><li>Graphics: 256 MB or higher (Pixel Shader 3.0, PCIe)<\/li><li>DirectX: Version 9.0c<\/li><li>Internet Connection Required<\/li><\/ul><br\/><br\/>  SUPPORTED VIDEO CARDS<br\/> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>ATI Radeon X1800 XT 512 MB or better<br\/><\/li><li> NVIDIA\u00a0GeForce\u00a07800 GT 256 MB or better<br\/><\/li><br\/><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1891352-box_nfsshift.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1891352-box_nfsshift.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1891352-box_nfsshift.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1891352-box_nfsshift.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1891352-box_nfsshift.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1891352-box_nfsshift.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1891352-box_nfsshift.png"},"name":"Need for Speed: SHIFT"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/2305413-darksiders2_2012_08_14_23_05_00_26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2305413\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/2305413-darksiders2_2012_08_14_23_05_00_26.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2305413\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/81005\/2305413-darksiders2_2012_08_14_23_05_00_26.png\"><\/a><figcaption>The game's evolving title screen.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Vigil Games allegedly began working on the sequel just a couple of months after releasing the original <a href=\"\/darksiders\/3030-20991\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20991\">Darksiders<\/a>. At the <a href=\"\/igda\/3015-4949\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4949\">IGDA<\/a> Leadership Forum, <a href=\"\/danny-bilson\/3040-14620\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-14620\">Danny Bilson<\/a> mentioned further details regarding the future Darksiders title during his keynote speech. It was revealed that in Darksiders II, a new character will take center stage as the main protagonist, not <a href=\"\/war\/3005-997\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-997\">War<\/a>. While the sequel's protagonist is not War, the Apocalypse only happens once so the story will be set concurrently with the first game. For the July 2011 issue of Game Informer magazine it was revealed the new protagonist is <a href=\"..\/..\/death\/94-11419\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Darksiders was released in the US on August 14, 2012 for <a href=\"..\/..\/pc\/60-94\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PC<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/playstation-3\/60-35\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation 3<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/xbox-360\/60-20\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox 360<\/a>; the game was released a week later, August 21st, in Europe.

However, because the Apocalypse occurred millenia too soon, Humanity was completely wiped out by the demons who rampaged across the Earth. At the same time, Death seeks to keep his brother War protected during his journey to clear his name after he is framed for causing the Apocalypse.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is a sub-plot of the game that regards the origins of the four horseman and their once glorious race known as the Nephilim, as well as further explanation about who The Makers were. There was an official Comic released that focused on the other horseman and it has been hinted many times that they will all appear a lot more in Darksiders II.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The new combat system is much faster, and more reliant on offensive agile maneuvers than War's more tank-like reactive combat; while War, as the incarnation of violence, was able to withstand mighty blows, Death is frailer than his brother, unable to block, and must rely on dodging to avoid damage. Despite the concept being intrinsically tied to War, Wrath is once again the 'magic' of the game, offering up special attacks and abilities to add variety to combat as well as <a href=\"\/secondary-weapons\/3015-3303\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3303\">secondary weapons<\/a> for changing up combos and reacting to specific enemy types.<\/p><p style=\"\">The new <a href=\"\/loot-gathering\/3015-161\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-161\">loot system<\/a> puts a bigger emphasis on allowing the player to create a version of Death that plays the way they want to, with, for example, items that give more wrath allowing you to be more like a spell caster and weapons designed for <a href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee<\/a> giving bonuses to regular combat.<\/p><h3>RPG Stats<\/h3><p style=\"\">Stats are now also a big part of the game emphasizing how much more of an <a href=\"\/rpg-elements\/3015-3603\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3603\">RPG<\/a> Darksiders II is in comparison to the first game. Although planned for the first game development constraints prevented the stat system from making its way in but it has returned for Darksiders 2 and is fully utilized to coincide with the loot system.<\/p><p style=\"\">The four primary stats are Strength, Defense, Agility and Arcane the allocation of which determines how you wish to play your version of Death.<\/p><h3>Weapons and Gear<\/h3><ul><li><b>A large Two-Handed Mace<\/b> with an <a href=\"..\/..\/splash-damage\/92-347\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">area-of-effect<\/a> <a href=\"\/knock-back\/3015-1912\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1912\">knockback<\/a>.<\/li><li><b>Dual wielded <a href=\"\/scythe\/3055-95\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-95\">Scythes<\/a><\/b> that merge in to one <b>Giant Scythe<\/b> at the end of each combo.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">All weapons have a level of quality and various stats with the strongest being called \"Possessed\" weapons which can be fed other items in order to grow more powerful. So far gear items that look strikingly similar to those of the first game are;<\/p><ul><li><b>Deathgrip<\/b> - primarily used for navigating and traversing the world like War's Abyssal Chain and also has the dual function of pulling smaller enemies\/objects to you and pulling you towards larger ones.<\/li><li><b>The Void Walker<\/b> - a portal generator for getting to otherwise unreachable areas.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Most weapons and <a href=\"\/armor\/3055-574\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-574\">armour<\/a> come in the form of loot items such as in an RPG and are fully <a href=\"\/customization\/3015-233\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-233\">customizable<\/a> but designed to all fit together regardless of combination. Different stats will be better for different specializations.<\/p><h3>Despair<\/h3><p style=\"\">Death has his spectral mount <a href=\"..\/..\/despair\/94-20527\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Despair<\/a>; much like <a href=\"..\/..\/ruin\/94-13601\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruin<\/a> in the first Darksiders, Despair acts as Death's mode of fast transportation across the world of Darksiders II. This time around he has been part of the game design from the beginning, and Despair is available from the start of the game; the is in contrast to Ruin, who was encountered late within the first game, as its environments were supposedly developed prior to Ruin being added to the game as an active mechanic.<\/p><h3>Reaper Form<\/h3><p style=\"\">As War had his Chaos form so does Death have his Reaper form; a much larger, more powerful super-state that grants far greater amounts of power for a short period of time. Since Death is a more flashy, egotistical character than the brutally pragmatic War, his Reaper form is featured in <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes<\/a> as well.<\/p><h3>Wrath Powers<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2305399\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2305399\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/81005\/2305399-darksiders2_2012_08_14_15_10_26_56.png\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><b>Harbinger Tree<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Teleport Slash<\/li><li>Harvest<\/li><li>Unstoppable<\/li><li>Frenzy<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><b>Necromancer Tree<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2305401\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2305401\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/81005\/2305401-darksiders2_2012_08_19_14_10_38_56.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Death using \"Murder\".<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li>Exhume<\/li><li>Aegis Guard<\/li><li>Murder<\/li><li>Bone Storm<\/li><\/ul><h2>Development<\/h2><p style=\"\">Death was designed very differently from War, appearing lean but not emaciated, a distinct contrast to his usual depiction as a cloaked skeleton. His armor is very similar to War's in design, though with Death preferring to forsake any torso or shoulder armor to give him the maximum amount of maneuverability - unlike War, Death cannot block, and relies entirely on dodges to avoid injury.<\/p><p style=\"\">The four horseman themselves are the last remaining members of a race known as the Nephilim, incredibly powerful super-beings with varying forms relatively similar to that of humans. The four were controlled by the neutral faction known as the Charred Council, initially represented as three giant stone faces in the first game. The Nephilim were almost wiped out after they declared war on Heaven; it was believed that the role of the species who would sway the Balance in the End War would go to the Nephilim, who were outraged when instead that destiny was given to the mortal race of <a href=\"\/human\/3015-810\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">Humans<\/a>. The forces of Light wiped out all but four of the Nephilim in the ensuing war.<\/p><p style=\"\">The primary setting for Darksiders II is a realm of forgotten battlefields and destroyed worlds left behind by countless wars between Heaven and Hell.

He finds himself in a castle in 1840s Brennenburg, and all that he seems to be able to remember is his name, the fact that he lives in London and that something called a shadow is hunting him down. The game has three different endings that are largely chosen by the player in the final moments of the game.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1542228-amnesia02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1542228\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1542228-amnesia02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1542228\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/10\/106662\/1542228-amnesia02.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Sanity stops draining whilst in lit areas.  <\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first-person <a href=\"\/survival-horror\/3015-4801\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival horror<\/a> game which focuses the player on exploring a centuries-old Prussian castle whilst avoiding elements of danger and being careful of the supernatural.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game has a health system that includes Daniel's psychological health (sanity) as well as his physical health. Seeing and being involved in disturbing events in the game will drain his sanity, eventually leaving him with hallucinations and impaired movement and vision. Dips in Daniel's sanity allow the supernatural to spot him quickly. Sanity stops draining when in lit areas, and it regenerates to a healthy state if Daniel solves a puzzle. The sanity system can be considered similar to the one found in <a href=\"\/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem\/3030-7512\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7512\">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem.<\/a> However sanity cannot explicitly lead to killing the player, unlike physical health.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game utilizes a lighting system which affects the sanity of a character (darkness being detrimental to Daniel's sanity). The player collects and refills their <a href=\"\/lantern\/3055-1978\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1978\">lantern<\/a>, which helps light the way, but also collects tinderboxes to light <a href=\"\/torch\/3055-484\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-484\">torches<\/a> or <a href=\"\/candle\/3055-814\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-814\">candles<\/a>. The lighting system creates a balance between maintaining your sanity and hiding from elements of danger.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57879\/1638154-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.03.25_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638154\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57879\/1638154-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.03.25_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638154\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/5\/57879\/1638154-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.03.25_am.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The inventory screen.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Additionally, the lighting ties heavily into the <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a> aspect of the game. Daniel has no means of defence, so the game explicitly states to the player at the start of the game that they should use their wits instead. This can include staying in the dark and moving carefully at the cost of his sanity, or using the environment to create distractions (such as by throwing a bottle to make a noise), and running away when spotted. This is the style typical of the developer <a href=\"\/frictional-games\/3010-2417\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2417\">Frictional Games<\/a>' <a href=\"\/penumbra\/3025-1219\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1219\"><i>Penumbra<\/i><\/a> franchise.<\/p><p style=\"\">Along the journey, the player can collect notes that offer insight into the story but also help solve puzzles. Puzzles in the game can involve the span of numerous rooms, manipulating contraptions and the like. They can also be simpler: for example, combining two items in your inventory to open a door.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101494\/1703848-a12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1703848\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101494\/1703848-a12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1703848\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/10\/101494\/1703848-a12.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The gloomy wine cellar.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In an effort to recover his lost memory, Daniel proceeds through the halls of Castle Brennenburg. He finds a page from his own journal that explains that he must find and kill the Baron <a href=\"\/alexander-of-brennenburg\/3005-17785\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17785\">Alexander of Brennenburg<\/a>. The note also explains that Daniel is being pursued by what can only be described as a sentient nightmare that cannot be harmed in any meaningful way.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Daniel makes progress into the Castle's entrance hall, he is greeted with a flashback that details a tidbit of a conversation between what appears to be himself and another individual. It becomes clear that Daniel is to follow the red rose petals that litter the ground. Just as he begins to do so, a large fleshy wall impedes his progress.<\/p><p style=\"\">Daniel then decides to explore the laboratory. Once there, he discovers a note that explains that someone has locked a party of men in the wine cellar. Daniel decides that this is to be his next stop. After obtaining the key to enter the cellar from the archive room, he enters the incredibly gloomy wine cellar. The aforementioned party of men has, as expected, long since expired, and their remains litter the floor. Among them, a note is found explaining that they delivered hundreds of innocent men, women, and children to the Baron in exchange for political advancement.<\/p><p style=\"\">Daniel returns to the laboratory to create a chemical compound using the components he discovered in the cellar. With this acidic compound in hand, he returns to the entrance hall to splash it on the flesh wall. Sure enough, he evaporates the wall opening a path.<\/p><p style=\"\">This path takes Daniel to the refinery where he encounters his first monster. After it passes, he proceeds through a trap door into the cellar archives where he discovers that a water demon now inhabits the flooded area. After leaping from box to box in an effort to confuse the monster, he narrowly escapes through the door to the back hall where he is greeted with a calming fountain and a brightly lit room.<\/p><p style=\"\">Daniel continues to follow his <a href=\"\/flashback\/3015-226\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-226\">flashbacks<\/a> to an elevator lever that no longer functions. Upon learning this, Daniel explores Baron Alexander's study. Daniel makes a grizzly discovery upon arriving in the Baron's office. He has been attempting to harness some primal breed of energy from animals. In a note left on his desk, he explains that the energy is only released when the creature is about to experience death so being able to harness it with any sort of regularity will prove difficult.<\/p><p style=\"\">The next stop is the guest bedroom where Daniel is quick to recall that he stayed here fairly recently. A journal page left here details an orb that he pulled out of a tomb on a recent excavation. The orb he explains contained a wondrous power but just as he felt it in his grasp, it shattered into pieces that he could not reassemble. Daniel then recalls that he left the key to the machine room behind a painting in his room. That in hand and a quick trip to a nearby storage room, he proceeds into the machine room to repair the elevator.<\/p><p style=\"\">Another collection of Daniel's journal entries explains why he came to the castle in the first place. Apparently, he found himself haunted by horrid dreams after his incident with the orb. He requested the aid of three specialists as a means of getting to the source of his new affliction. Much to his dismay, all of the men ended up brutally murdered. Daniel then attempted to contact others who may know something more about the orb. He received varying responses but the urgency of the Baron's return letter piqued his interest. Baron Alexander requested that Daniel come to his castle right away before it is too late. Orb pieces in hand, he went straight to the Baron's castle.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57879\/1638152-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.00.15_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638152\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57879\/1638152-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.00.15_am.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1638152\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/5\/57879\/1638152-screen_shot_2010_11_22_at_4.00.15_am.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The fountain in The Great Hall.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Once inside the elevator, it lowers him partway before malfunctioning and sending him into free fall. He crawls from the wreckage into a prison block that is shrouded in total darkness. A flashback explains that the Baron also carries the responsibility of a prison warden. After some careful traversing, he procures a hammer and chipper which he uses to widen a tunnel within a previous inmate's cell. Again more perilous trekking leads Daniel out of the prison and into the cistern. A flashback explains that the Baron uses this area as a secret underground passage. As is Daniel's luck, the route his former self used has been entirely blocked. This time a flood impedes his progress.<\/p><p style=\"\">Daniel finds that the flood water can be drained from a nearby room. In this room he also finds a journal entry that details a warding ritual performed by the Baron. Daniel willingly had this ritual performed in an effort to slow the impeding doom of this shadow beast. The ritual involved killing a man the Baron claimed was a murderer.<\/p><p style=\"\">Daniel then discovers that a poisonous fungi now inhabits the no longer flooded route into the sewer. He proceeds into the morgue which contains numerous bodies as one might expect. Daniel locates a note that details a toxin that wiped out most of Alexander's servants. The note goes on to explain that he has indeed developed an antidote that will surely stop the outbreak. Daniel observes that the Baron has made this antidote using the body of an infected servant. Daniel extracts the antidote and enters the sewers.<\/p><p style=\"\">After evading yet more monsters in the sewers, Daniel arrives at the nave. This is a much more visibly depraved area of the Baron's castle as it functioned as an area for prisoner's who awaited torture. Upon entering the center of this area, Daniel is introduced to <a href=\"\/heinrich-cornelius-agrippa\/3005-19409\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19409\">Agrippa<\/a>, a shattered husk of a man who claims to be able to aid Daniel. He explains that Alexander has been using destroyed pieces of another orb in torture as they seem to produce intense anxiety in his victims. If Daniel can reunite those pieces, he may be able to stop Alexander from using the new restored orb that past Daniel had inadvertently handed him. Agrippa also requests that he create a tonic for him that would free him from the shattered husk he currently resides in.<\/p><p style=\"\">Daniel then enters the various torture chambers in an effort to locate the old orb chunks. He also begins to suffer horrible flashbacks as he begins to realize what he has become. Daniel had been aiding the Baron in the torture of the countless innocents the Baron had delivered to his castle. He did so as the Baron claimed their suffering and sacrifice would surely slow the advancement of the shadow demon. As his grief overtakes him, Daniel recalls that the Baron and he raided a small farm home killing the husband and kidnapping the wife and her three daughters for sacrifices. A journal entry explains that Daniel no longer feels justified in the killing to keep back the beast. In this entry, he curses the Baron for making him do these horrid things and claims his revenge.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Daniel returns to Agrippa to ask what he is to do next, he is swarmed by monsters who lock him in a nearby cell. Daniel's escape is quick but the Baron's voice fills his head taunting him. Suddenly, something terrible begins to chase Daniel. He narrowly escape back to the nave. Once there, he creates the tonic that supposedly will free Agrippa. Agrippa drinks it and requests that Daniel remove his head.<\/p><p style=\"\">Daniel now enters the chancel to reunite the orb. A path opens leading to Alexander's hollowed inner sanctum. To enter the orb chamber where Alexander is surely awaiting Daniel makes a blood sacrifice and enters. A naked floating Baron greets Daniel there. He explains that he is hardly evil and that Daniel is to share blame in much of what has transpired. Alexander goes on to say that he is going to harness the power of the shadow which has grown tremendously with all the sacrifices to warp himself into another world. The three endings are as follows.<\/p><h3>Endings<\/h3><ul><li><b>Good Ending<\/b>: Daniel throws Agrippa's head into the newly opened portal. Daniel and the Baron are consumed by the shadow but Agrippa calls upon a man named Johann Weyer to free Daniel from the abyss.<\/li><li><b>Revenge Ending<\/b>: Daniel destroys the portal before it can open, and the shadow consumes the Baron but spares Daniel. Daniel leaves the castle with a guilt-free conscience.<\/li><li><b>Bad Ending<\/b>: The Baron escapes to the other world. The shadow consumes Daniel.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Development<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>Amnesia: The Dark Descent<\/i> started off a very different game than the final product; it contained a more traditional structure, with the main character running around several hub worlds that could be completed in any order, collecting money that he could then give to NPCs to help solve puzzles or advance the story. The story itself was very different as well; according to an early pitch document, it would involve the main character traveling to a Castle (much like Brennenberg) in order to prevent an evil \"Nobleman\" (much like Alexander) from orchestrating an unspecified evil plan. Killing enemies was originally a larger part of the game, even though the document states that \"combat is not a large part of the gameplay\"; the main character was to be given various weapons, including melee weapons and a bow &amp; arrow. The player could even trick monsters into walking into pools of electrified water and other such environmental hazards.<\/p><p style=\"\">While the game that Frictional originally had in mind was vastly different, there were some very distinct similarities. First there are \"Visions,\" which were the predecessor of the flashbacks, and act as such. The puzzles, as outlined in the document, are identical to those found in the finished product: the team talks about balancing the slow, thinking puzzles against the \"action\" puzzles, such as when the player need to clear the debris during the encounter with the water monster. The interplay between light and darkness was still there, though it differed in the sense that light would restore strength, and that lighting a corridor would also make it <i>easier<\/i> to pass the monster. Also, they kept the diary entries, though they were written by other characters instead of the protagonist.<\/p><p style=\"\">So, some things changed and others stayed the same. In the end, the team found restraint, choosing not to include the \"gamey-er\" elements and instead going for a so-called \"purer\" horror experience.<\/p><h2>Justine Expansion<\/h2><p style=\"\">In conjunction with the <a href=\"\/portal-2\/3030-21662\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21662\">Portal 2<\/a> Potato Sack ARG, in which <a href=\"\/valve-corporation\/3010-1374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve<\/a> held a sale of 13 indie games on <a href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam<\/a> which were then subsequently invaded by various forms of <a href=\"\/glados\/3005-722\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-722\">GLaDOS<\/a>, Frictional released a short expansion to the main game, titled \" <a href=\"\/justine-florebelle\/3005-18629\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18629\">Justine<\/a>\". The expansion offers a different type of horror than the base game, this time being a collection of puzzle rooms tied together by an omniscient narrator (not unlike <a href=\"\/portal\/3025-588\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-588\">Portal<\/a>). A new monster features - the \"suitor\" - and your character this time is female. It is loosely tied to the main game, with a collectible note from Daniel. It also, strangely, does not allow you to save, and once you die it crashes to the desktop. Although this is clearly a bug, the developers sarcastically claim that this was a deliberate choice made to \"ratchet up the tension\".<\/p><p style=\"\">Justine wakes up in a dungeon, at the bottom of a castle, with a monster at her doorstep. Like Daniel, she doesn't know who she is or why she's here, and so is led along by the voice of Justine, a twisted and mysterious woman, emitting from various phonographs around the dungeon. She has kidnapped three people who were important in her life, and she asks you to spare them or kill them. The aforementioned monster comes in three forms (though they are the same visual model), each a different suitor for Justine. Players travel through the dungeon and slowly unravel who they are and who Justine is.<\/p><p style=\"\">It is currently unavailable if not bought through Steam, though Frictional has promised to bring it to other <a href=\"\/digital-distribution\/3015-2329\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2329\">digital distribution<\/a> services.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>According to the original pitch document, the game was at first called \"Unknown\".<\/li><li>Inside the game installation one can find a locked archive file called supersecret.rar. Inside the file one can find a variety of media which relate to the games development such as level progress flowcharts, concept art, early videos etc. The password to this file is

What sets this game apart from recent Need For Speed games is the ability to play as a police officer as well as a street racer, with full career modes for both. The racer's career mode is all about driving really fast, racing and outrunning the cops, while the police officer's career mode is all about chasing down the racers and busting them. The career mode for both racers and cops consists entirely of events, with no plot or story.<\/p><p style=\"\">Specifically, the police officer will have to ram or otherwise damage the racer's vehicle until its energy bar is depleted. The racer, on the other hand, will have to escape and avoid destruction. This mechanic is similar to that in the game's predecessors, such as Most Wanted or Carbon.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game is set in the fictional location <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2509\" href=\"\/fictional-locations-based-on-real-ones\/3015-2509\/\">Seacrest County<\/a>. Players are able to race in a wide array of settings, including desert, forest, seaside and mountainous regions, both on-road and off in the form of shortcuts.<\/p><h2>Game Modes<\/h2><p style=\"\">While playing through the offline \"Career\" mode, players will unlock various events which each adhere to a specific set of rules depending on the mode.<\/p><h3>Police Modes<\/h3><ul><li><b>Hot Pursuit -<\/b> The player must attempt to shutdown a race in progress by wrecking the racers or using weapons against them. The number of racers, the number of \"busts\" required, and the weapons available change from event to event.<\/li><li><b>Interceptor<\/b> - This is a 1v1 gametype in which the cop must bust the racer before he is able to escape. The opposing racer is not limited to a track and is able to take any road in sight and may also turn around when the player least expects it. The weapons available change from event to event.<\/li><li><b>Rapid Response<\/b> - Essentially a time trial in which the player can pick from any car unlocked in the available class in an attempt to finish within a certain time.<\/li><li><b>Preview<\/b> - Another time trial variant in which the player is given a specific car and must finish within a certain time.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Racer Modes<\/h3><ul><li><b>Race<\/b> - The player must beat opposing A.I. in a flat out race where any unlocked car within the given class can be chosen. No cops are present during these races and no weapons or abilities are present.<\/li><li><b>Hot Pursuit<\/b> - The player attempts to finish the race in first place as well as surviving cop pressure. Weapons are available and vary from event to event.<\/li><li><b>Preview<\/b> - Time trial variant in which the player is given a specific car and must finish within a certain time.<\/li><li><b>Time trial<\/b> - Any car can be used within the given class and the race must be finished within a certain time.<\/li><li><b>Gauntlet<\/b> - Another time trial variant, this time with police pressure and weapons available.<\/li><li><b>Duel<\/b> - Simply a 1v1 race to the finish.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Weapons \/ Abilities<\/h2><h3>Racers<\/h3><p style=\"\">The racers have different special abilities which they unlock as the race progresses, each mapped to a button on the d-pad. They include:<\/p><ul><li><b>Spike Strip<\/b> - Disables the vehicle (as it spins and comes to a complete halt) for a short while. It will also do some damage to the vehicle.<\/li><li><b>Jammer<\/b> <b>-<\/b> Briefly disables the GPS of opponents, will jam the HUD of the chaser, and will also prevent the Cop from calling in any help (Spikes, Heli, Road Block, EMP). In addition, the Jammer stops EMP lock ons and disables deployed Spike Strips.<\/li><li><b>Turbo<\/b> - A more powerful nitrous boost. The entire screen of the racer will warp as the player activates this ability.<\/li><li><b>EMP<\/b> - Causes long range damage, as well as slightly slowing down the opponent and affecting handling.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Cops<\/h3><p style=\"\">The cop will also be able to use different special abilities to bust the racer, each mapped to a button on the d-pad. They include:<\/p><ul><li><b>Spike Strips<\/b> - Disables the vehicle (as it spins and comes to a complete halt) for a short while. It will also do some damage to the vehicle.<\/li><li><b>Helicopter<\/b> - The chopper will track down racers and thus increase the radius of the search area. It will also be able to lay down spike strips as the ability is upgraded to a higher level.<\/li><li><b>Road Blocks<\/b> - Sets up police cars to block the road ahead. If the racer or cop hits the road block they will take damage, but there is also a small area which racers may escape.<\/li><li><b>EMP<\/b> - Causes long range damage, as well as slightly slowing down the opponent and affecting handling.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">For both Racer and Cop, the abilities receive upgrades based on player progress. For example, the police chopper may not initially be able to lay down spike belts early in the game. As the player progresses, however, the chopper will be able to do such things. In addition, spike strips increase from 1 to 2 dropped at one time.<\/p><p style=\"\">The majority of cars have police variants. Some cars are exclusive to racers, while some are exclusive to the police. It is also worth noting that police variants of cars available in the game are generally slightly faster than the normal ones. The handling of cars in game is also much more similar to that in the early <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"\/burnout\/3025-76\/\">Burnout<\/a> series games.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer Modes<\/h2><ul><li><b>Race<\/b> - 8-player races, no Cops.<\/li><li><b>Hot Pursuit<\/b> - 4 Racers vs 4 Cops.<\/li><li><b>Interceptor<\/b> - 1 Racer vs 1 Cop, free-roam.<\/li><li><b>Most Wanted<\/b> - Open world Cops vs Racers.

(via Armed &amp; Dangerous DLC)<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The game uses bounty as a form of experience points and it is universal for both players playing as police officers and street racers. The match options will be rated according to difficulty and carry a corresponding bounty payoff.<\/p><h2>Autolog<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95284\/1468900-nfshp_mp4_12ccop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468900\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/95284\/1468900-nfshp_mp4_12ccop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468900\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/95284\/1468900-nfshp_mp4_12ccop.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game's multi-player mode is brought together by Autolog. Autolog lets you keep track of your friend's times by pushing your friend's times, telling you on which track he did the time and how much you must do to beat it. Once you've beaten it, your time will be pushed back to your friend's console who'll be able to directly try to beat your new time. It also allows you to challenge them to pursuits, where one person plays as the cop while the other plays as the fugitive who's on the run. Autolog recommends ways to play the game depending on what the player's friends have been doing, and keeps track of your progress as you win bounty to unlock new cars.<\/p><h3>iPhone App<\/h3><p style=\"\">On December 15, 2010, EA released a free iPhone Autolog app. The name of the app is \"Need for Speed Autolog.\" As of November 8, 2011 the app has 15 ratings for an average score of 3\/5 stars.

It consists of 2 events. The first accessible event is a Hot Pursuit event called Dark Horse, where Players play as a cop. They must attempt to stop 4 other A.I. racers before they reach their destination. To help with this, the player has 2 weapons at his disposal. The first is a Spike Strip that drops directly behind the player's car. The second is a road block that is setup in front of the player. The more racers taken out before the end of the race the more bounty players receive. Bounty is a form of XP that is used to level up either the cop or the racer. Players can choose between the Nissan 370Z and the Ford Crown Victoria.<\/p><p style=\"\">The second event is only accessible if the player has someone on their friends list that has also played the demo. It is a race event called Roadsters Reborn. It's a simple point to point race with 5 other A.I. racers and no cops. The player is rewarded more bounty the better they finish. The cars to choose from are the Nissan 370Z Roadster, BMW Z4 sDrive35is and Porsche Boxster Spyder.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Demo features only two songs: Pint Shot Riot's \"Nothing from You (Redenka Remix)\", and 30 Seconds to Mars' \"Edge of the Earth\" (which is also featured at the title screen). Both the 360 and the PS3 play game soundtrack in the Race Event only, there is no music in the Hot Pursuit event. Custom soundtracks on the PS3 and 360 are limited to saved playlists only. On the PS3, this effectively limits the player to locally-stored music, while the XBOX 360 allows for playlists saved on a media server.<\/p><h2>E3 2010<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game was first shown during E3 2010. It was revealed during the EA press conference which opened with the game's reveal trailer. The game was then demoed on stage (where the people demoing the game had a slight technical problem with a loading screen) where the developers revealed the game's chase mechanics and explained Auto-Log.<\/p><h2>PC Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum Specs<\/h3><ul><li><b>OS<\/b>: Windows\u00ae XP SP 3 (32-64 bits) \/ Windows Vista\u00ae (32-64 bits) \/ Windows 7\u00ae (32-64 bits)<\/li><li><b>CPU<\/b>: Intel Core\u00ae 2 Duo 1.8 GHZ or AMD Athlon X2 64 2.4GHZ<\/li><li><b>RAM<\/b>: 1.5 GB Windows\u00ae XP \/ 2 GB Windows Vista\u00ae \u2013 Windows 7\u00ae<\/li><li><b>DISC DRIVE<\/b>: DVD-ROM, 8 speed<\/li><li><b>HARD DRIVE<\/b>: 6.5 GB<\/li><li><b>VIDEO CARD<\/b>: 256 MB DirectX\u00ae 9.0 compliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher<\/li><li><b>SOUND CARD<\/b>: DirectX 9.0 \u2013compliant sound card<\/li><li><b>COMPATIBLE VIDEO CARD CHIP SETS<\/b>: ATI\u00ae RADEON\u00ae X1950, HD 2000\/3000\/4000\/5000 series NVIDIA GeForce\u00ae 7\/8\/9\/100\/200 series<\/li><li><b>ONLINE<\/b>: 2 \u2013 8 players, 512 Kbps or faster<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1828913-box_nfshp.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1828913-box_nfshp.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1828913-box_nfshp.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1828913-box_nfshp.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1828913-box_nfshp.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1828913-box_nfshp.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1828913-box_nfshp.png"},"name":"Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Dark Void is a single-player, third-person action game that combines a <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover system<\/a> influenced by <a href=\"\/gears-of-war\/3025-565\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-565\">Gears of War<\/a> with flying segments reminiscent of <a href=\"\/crimson-skies-high-road-to-revenge\/3030-12911\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12911\">Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge<\/a>, which several members of the Dark Void development team had worked on previously.

Will and Ava then take off in their plane, along with another friend Coop Williams, across the Atlantic ocean.<\/p><p style=\"\">The flight goes according to plan until Will points out that they are flying over the <a href=\"\/bermuda-triangle\/3035-3050\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3050\">Bermuda Triangle<\/a>. After joking about this to Ava and Coop, Will exclaims that he has seen a <a href=\"\/ufo\/3055-611\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-611\">UFO<\/a>. The bright light of the UFO then fills the cockpit and the plane begins to spin out of control. The cockpit's instruments start to go haywire and the plane then begins to lose altitude. The cabin then tears at the seams as Coop falls out of the plane to his death. This leaves Will and Ava crash landing into a foreign land.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234100-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_268.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234100\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234100-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_268.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234100\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/669\/1234100-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_268.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Nikola Tesla<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Several hours later, Will wakes up in the midst of a dense jungle. He travels for some time until he meets up with Ava once again. Near them, a Survivor fighter hiding from a Watcher patrol. Will and Ava manage to escape from the alien creatures into the safety of a cave, which collapses leaving them separated once again. Ava then remembers that see saw a village in the plane before they crashed and tells Will to meet her there to figure out where they are.<\/p><p style=\"\">Will travels to this strange village, fighting off The Watchers with weapons he has salvaged. He meets Ava once again at the entrance of the Village. They arrive to see the village inhabitants gathered around the village leader. The leader tells Ava and Will that they are not welcome in their village and will be forced to leave. When leaving the town, a villager quietly calls them over to his hut, whose name is Tavi. Tavi then tells them to follow him to a nearby cave to meet someone. There, Will and Ava meet the infamous <a href=\"\/nikola-tesla\/3005-9322\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9322\">Nikola Tesla<\/a>. Here, he gives Will his newly invented hover pack and tells him and Ava to go search for some supplies.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234108-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_214.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234108\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234108-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_214.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234108\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/669\/1234108-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_214.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Will's helmet<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When they return to Nikola, Will and Ava discover that the town has been invaded by The Watchers. The villagers in the town see the Watchers as gods. Will then enters the village and begins battle with the aliens. Ava is captured by one of The Watchers, known as a Guard. Will chases the Guard down and battles with it save Ava. When Ava is free, she decides to chase after The Watchers and follows them into the unknown, leaving Will behind.<\/p><p style=\"\">Back in Nikola's cave, Will spends all night trying to fix up a plane. He eventually gets frustrated and throws his wrench at the wall. The wrench hits a strange device. Will asks Tavi about the devices and Tavi tells him that it is an experimental <a href=\"\/jetpack\/3030-4921\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4921\">rocket pack<\/a>. Will then convinces Tavi to let him use it. Using the rocket pack, Will then travels outside around the area. Once outside, however, Will hears distress signals from some nearby soldiers asking for help against a Watcher patrol. Will then dispatches the patrol and makes his way into the Watcher base in the bottom of the canyon, by going to nearby towers and destroying the shield. When Will enters the base, he appears to be going through a strange tunnel. He then emerges through the far end of the tunnel to find himself in the Void.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234096-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234096\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234096-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_202.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234096\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/669\/1234096-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_202.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Will with Ava<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Once in the Void, Will meets <a href=\"\/atem\/3005-9383\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9383\">Atem<\/a>. Atem is part of the Survivors living in the Void.<\/p><p style=\"\">Their duty is to fight against The Watchers. Atem explains to Will that The Watchers were an alien race one lived on the Earth, enslaving the human race. The humans eventually rebelled against them and locked the Watchers into the Void, with no way back to Earth. Atem reveals that The Watchers may have found a way back to Earth. Will then escorts Atem back to the base camp, fighting off the hordes of Watchers.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the camp, Atem shows Will the Arc. The Arc is a large, flying metal building which houses the survivors. Atem then sends Will to the barracks and gives him an ancient Watcher helmet to help Will to fight against The Watchers. Will then sets off again to help more of the Survivors battle against The Watchers.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the battle, Will, Atem and some Survivors return to The Arc to see that Ava and Nikola Tesla have returned. Will demands that he have a talk with Ava about what happened to her and to discuss some things that happened several years before. Before Ava can explain, a large amount of The Watchers launch an attack on The Arc. Ava tells Will that she have a personal talk with him after the oncoming battle. Will then uses his rocket pack and an energy cannon given to him by Tesla to stop The Watchers destoying The Arc. Will then gives The Arc enough time to fly away from the dangers of The Watcher attack. The Arc is then piloted over a long river to safety.<\/p><p style=\"\">When save again, Atem begins to explain to Will about the meaning of why he is in the Void. Atem explains that Will is the<\/p><p style=\"\">\"Prophesied One\" and must continue to help The Survivors battle against The Watcher aggression. Atem then brings Will on a mission to save a number of imprisoned Survivors from a Watcher prison. During the mission, Atem reveals to Will that The Watchers are the ones who put the fascists in control of Germany. They will be responsible for the impending World War.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234055-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_142.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234055\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234055-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_142.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234055\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/669\/1234055-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_142.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The villagers bowing to a Watcher.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Once, these Survivors have been set free from their prison and returned to The Arc, The Arc is then attacked by a very large Watcher creature known as The Collector. The Collector traps The Arc, forcing Will to use his rocket pack against the massive creature. He shoots a number of it's weak spots and then makes it lose grip of The Arc by shooting it's massive boils. This leaves The Arc save once again. Will and Ava return to The Arc to celebrate when a Watcher creature attacks Will and brings him to a Watcher prison.<\/p><p style=\"\">Will is left trapped in a room until Atem and some Survivors burst into the room. They give Will a rifle to battle against a large number of Watcher forces that they must fight through to escape the prison. They fight until they get to the exit. Here, Atem returns Will's helmet and rocket pack back to him. Atem and Will then return to The Arc where Will meets up with Ava once again. Will is then told of his prophecy. He, along with Ava and the rest of the Survivors, must travel to a large tower that the Watchers use as their base. There, Will must destroy the link between the Earth and The Void so The Watchers must not travel through it.<\/p><p style=\"\">When Will, Ava and the Survivor forces get to the tower, they are met by a huge dragon-like creature. Will then battles the creature by shooting it's weak chest and then pull each of it's three eyes out. Once Will removes two of it's eyes, the creature smashes into the tower, along with Will. Will then throws his rocket pack to the creature's third and final eye and shoots it, causing a large explosion that kills the creature.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234077-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_169.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234077\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1234077-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_169.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234077\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/669\/1234077-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_169.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Ava<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Ava then lands on the tower to congratulate Will. Before they can speak to one another, the head of The Watchers appears. It tells them to leave the portal alone and to leave this place. Once Will says no, the Watcher throws a knife straight at Will. Ava then jumps in the way of the knife, taking the fatal blow. Will reacts angrily to this, by firing a few rounds into the Watcher's chest, killing it.<\/p><p style=\"\">Will holds Ava in his hands as she begins to say her final words. She tells him that the only way to close the portal back to the Earth is if they both hold each other's hand while Will stands in the portal. This will sacrifice Ava and will close the portal. Will rejects this at first but Ava convinces him otherwise. Will enters into the portal, holding his hands against Ava. Just before the portal closes, Will tells Ava that he loves her. The portal is then shut and Ava is left to die in the Void.<\/p><p style=\"\">Back on Earth, Will goes to <a href=\"\/london\/3035-212\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-212\">London<\/a>. This is the city where Ava was born. He is seen sitting on a park bench. When Ava was alive, she told Will of this bench that was near Westminster that overlooked the <a href=\"\/river-thames\/3035-2575\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2575\">River Thames<\/a>. She told Will that she would bring him there if they got out of <a href=\"\/the-void\/3035-3119\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3119\">The Void<\/a>. While Will sits there, Atem appears behind him. Atem says to Will that there is some business to be done.

While the rocket pack can be used at any time, it is primarily used for either extended jumps or continual flight; while a hover option does become available, it only provides a very slow descent instead of the ability to actually hover in place. The rocket pack also enables the player to fly over enemy cover and shoot them for the sky.<\/p><p style=\"\">This leads to the other mechanic used in Dark Void; <a href=\"\/vertical-cover\/3015-768\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-768\">vertical cover<\/a>. This involves the player moving their way either up or down ledges, that act as cover, through the environment. Most commonly this will be a canyon wall, although there are also some internal environments as well. While traversing these environments, the player will hang from a ledge, or crouch and peek over a ledge depending on the direction they are moving.<\/p><p style=\"\">Dogfighting is another feature commonly seen in Dark Void's gameplay.

The guns mounted on the rocket pack allow the player to shoot down these ships. The player is also able to \"skyjack\" enemy or friendly ships. When the player flies close to a ship, the game will prompt the player with a button to take over the ship. If the ship is friendly, this process is automatic. If the ship is controlled by an enemy, the player will have to beat a <a href=\"\/minigames\/3015-116\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-game<\/a> to take control of the ship. The player can also do special moves with the rocket pack. If the player push a specific button and moves Will in a number of directions, he will do a flip or a <a href=\"\/barrel-roll\/3015-343\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-343\">barrel roll<\/a> to dodge oncoming enemy fire.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p style=\"\">Will has access to four different weapons which he can use and upgrade.

The upgrading is done by using Tech Points. Tech points are earned by killing enemies and finding them in hidden areas of a level. Upgrades can be used to boost accuracy, increase damage, change clip size and other things. Each weapon has three levels and can be upgraded twice. The rocket pack can also be upgraded.<\/p><h2>Voice Cast<\/h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/will-grey\/3005-356\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-356\">Will Grey<\/a>, the protagonist of Dark Void, is voiced by prolific voice actor <a href=\"\/nolan-north\/3040-80008\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\">Nolan North<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/nikola-tesla\/3005-9322\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9322\">Nikola Tesla<\/a> is voiced by <a href=\"\/paul-eiding\/3040-3491\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3491\">Paul Eiding<\/a>, also known for providing the voice for <a href=\"\/colonel-roy-campbell\/3005-839\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Colonel Roy Campbell<\/a> from the <a href=\"\/metal-gear\/3025-5\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-5\">Metal Gear<\/a> series.<\/p><h2>Reception<\/h2><p style=\"\">Dark Void was met with a very mixed critical reception.

This marked McCreary's debut into the world of scoring video games as he was mostly scoring television at the time. From then McCreary has gone on to score the likes of <a href=\"\/socom-4-us-navy-seals\/3030-30196\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30196\">SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs<\/a>, <a href=\"\/moon-breakers\/3030-38351\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38351\">Moon Breakers<\/a> and upcoming MMO based on the SyFy original series, <a href=\"\/defiance\/3030-35523\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35523\">Defiance<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The score was praised among critics and added a lot to the game in terms of atmosphere and tone.

Instead of gathering resources from sites around the map, the battlefield is covered with strategic points. Each strategic point has one of two functions: it either adds to your resource income or it is victory point, necessary for a control point victory. In a standard match of DoW2, each side begins with 500 Victory Points. For each Victory point your team controls, the opposing team gradually loses points. If a team reaches zero victory points, they lose.<\/p><p style=\"\">The basic unit of conflict in DoW 2 is the squad. This is a group of 3-5 soldiers with a similar tactical role. They are ordered around as a unit and behave as a single unit, manuevering with each other for cover and line-of-sight as closely as possible. Each soldier in an individual squad is actually an independent entity with its own HP bar and gun; the squad's members act quite independently of one another, but their attentions are always on a single target and cannot be split. As soldiers are lost, the squad can be retreated back to base for reinforcement, bringing the squad back to full strength. Through creative manuevering and positioning of squads, points are taken and victory assured.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11419\/238767-a3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238767\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11419\/238767-a3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238767\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11419\/238767-a3.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A Space Marine Dreadnought tackles the Eldar.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Each squad has a list of individual upgrades available to it. These weapons serve to diversify or specialize that squad--a Tactical Marine Squad might procure a Rocket Launcher to improve their anti-vehicular capabilites or instead opt for the Plasma Gun to generally improve the squad's damage output. Appropriate use of heavy weapons is vital to effective countering as these weapon upgrades usually do massive damage when compared to the basic weapons of their type; they can also allow the squad to use new abilities that increase your options in combat, such as suppressive fire modes or stealth.<\/p><p style=\"\">Cover is the summation of terrain advantage in DoW. A squad is in heavy, light, or no cover at all times. Squads that are in cover take greatly reduced damage from non-explosive weapons. Effective use of cover (and circumvention of the enemy's) is the deciding factor in many conflicts. It is still impossible to construct cover in Dawn of War 2, as it was in Dawn of War 1, but it is now possible to destroy nearly all environmental cover, unlike in Dawn of War 1, making cover a less reliable mechanic than it was in the prequel.<\/p><h3>The Departures<\/h3><p style=\"\">The majority of the base building in DOW2 has been discarded, putting an emphasis on squad customization and in-combat tactics. Each player's base consists of one unit production facility and two turrets for protection against raids. The main base structure has two upgrades that function as the only \"teching\" the game has to offer; these upgrades allow the main base to construct newer, potentially superior, units as well as increase the options for equipment on all units.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/1035766-dow2_2009_05_25_22_26_43_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1035766\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/1035766-dow2_2009_05_25_22_26_43_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1035766\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/56\/1035766-dow2_2009_05_25_22_26_43_10.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The battle rages.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Power strategic points have been added to the game, replacing the more freeform power generation that was possible in DOW1. By capturing and then upgrading a Power Point, one can choose to build additional Power Generators in its vicinity to increase your power output. The same idea applies to the normal requisition points. This change moves the \"base building\" further onto the battlefield, making your production lines a lot more vulnerable.<\/p><p style=\"\">As units kill or assist in the killing of enemy units they are now capable of levelling up, improving statistically in the process (i.e. more HP, greater weapon accuracy). This increases the gravity of squad loss; older squads become less disposable when they are superior to newer troops. As in Company of Heroes, if any member of a squad survives combat the entire squad retains its veterancy level.<\/p><p style=\"\">While the concept of weapon upgrades did exist in the original Dawn of War, each commander now has a large array of potential items to equip themselves with rather than the simple upgrades of the past. A commander can wear three pieces of wargear at a time: a weapon, armor, and an item generally tied to their speciality. Don't worry about wanting to switch to another item as the game progresses; not only can you buy other items filling the item slot but you can switch back to the older upgrade for free if desired.<\/p><h2>Single Player Campaign<\/h2><p style=\"\">The single player campaign of Dawn of War II is played from the perspective of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-651\" href=\"\/adeptus-astartes-space-marines\/3015-651\/\" slug=\"adeptus-astartes-space-marines\">Space Marines<\/a> in the Aurelia Sector. The story follows the adventures of a newly promoted Force Commander and his crew as they take back and crush invading legions of Orks, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1272\" href=\"\/eldar\/3015-1272\/\" slug=\"eldar\">Eldar<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2514\" href=\"\/tyranids\/3015-2514\/\" slug=\"tyranids\">Tyranids<\/a> (the other three factions in multiplayer).<\/p><p style=\"\">Dawn of War II's singleplay focuses on controlling squads headed by unique character types. Players will select their squads and loadouts before a battle and then select a conflict zone from a world map to engage the enemy. Rather than build bases and amass gigantic assault forces, players will instead use their initially selected units and squads to essentially complete the entire mission. By the end of the campaign, 6 squads become available for deployment but only 4 can be selected for each mission. The squads available to the player are:<\/p><h3>The Force Commander \"<a data-ref-id=\"3005-21130\" href=\"\/aramus\/3005-21130\/\" slug=\"aramus\">Aramus<\/a>\"<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10460\/809719-dow2_sergeant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-809719\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10460\/809719-dow2_sergeant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-809719\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10460\/809719-dow2_sergeant.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Blood Ravens' Force Commander<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">A newly promoted Commander is sent to the Aurulia sector to lead the Blood Ravens' darkest hour. His reputation is such that the chapter expects that his leadership will be enough to tip the scales and save the Calderis system. A man of few words, he is known for keeping calm in tense situations always managing to find a path through to victory in the face of overwhelming odds. In battle he wields his Chainsword and Bolt Pistol or Two-Handed Thunder Hammer and uses Battle Cries to intimidate and command.<\/p><h3>The Devastator Squad \" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9049\" href=\"\/avitus\/3005-9049\/\" slug=\"avitus\"><b>Avitus<\/b><\/a>\"<\/h3><p style=\"\">The Devastator squad is let into battle by Avitus, a man famous for his hatred for the enemy, he distinguished himself in battle during the assault against treasonous Imperial Guard forces in Victory Bay during the Dark Crusade. Most of his squadmates did not survive the fighting causing Avitus to hate the Guardsmen and he continues to see them as traitors and weaklings to this day. In battle his squad wields the Chapter's heaviest weaponry such as Heavy Bolters and Plasma Cannons to support Assault and Tactical Squads, they are most commonly found in key positions with good fields of fire engaging the enemy from great ranges.<\/p><h3>The Scout Squad \" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9050\" href=\"\/cyrus\/3005-9050\/\" slug=\"cyrus\"><b>Cyrus<\/b><\/a>\"<\/h3><p style=\"\">The veteran scout Cyrus has chosen to dedicate his life to training the Chapter's newest initiates who serve as the Blood Ravens' Scouts honing them into fully-fledged Space Marines. Cyrus leads the lightly armoured Scouts and rely on stealth to gather intelligence, assassinate key targets and initiate surprise assaults. Few in the chapter will admit the need for cloak and dagger tactics but Cyrus' actions has brought countless victories in battle.<\/p><h3>The Tactical Squad \" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9051\" href=\"\/tarkus\/3005-9051\/\" slug=\"tarkus\"><b>Tarkus<\/b><\/a>\"<\/h3><p style=\"\">Tarkus, the leader of one of the Chapters tactical squad, is a veteran of centuries of campaigning and is renowned for his cool under fire, confidence and steely demeanour. Tarkus and his squad repelled wave after wave of Necrons in the Catacombs of Kronus during the Dark Crusade campaign earning Terminator Honours. The Tactical Marines are the mainstay of Space Marines Chapters, versatile front lines units who bear the brunt of all operations, they wield a wide variety of weapons such as Bolters, Flamers and Plasma guns and can absorb an amazing amount of punishment from enemy fire.<\/p><h3>The Assault Squad \" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9052\" href=\"\/thaddeus\/3005-9052\/\" slug=\"thaddeus\"><b>Thaddeus<\/b><\/a>\"<\/h3><p style=\"\">The recently promoted Sergant Thaddeus made his name battling Orks on Calderis and Typhon. He now leads the Chapter's Assault Marines into close quarters combat using their jump packs to close with the enemy dropping from the sky into their ranks.<\/p><h3>The Dreadnought \" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9009\" href=\"\/brother-captain-davian-thule\/3005-9009\/\" slug=\"brother-captain-davian-thule\"><b>Captain Thule<\/b><\/a>\"<\/h3><p style=\"\">As the saying goes, even in death Captain Davian Thule still serves. Having been cured of Tyranid poisoning well enough to keep him from succumbing to its effects, the venerable Captain is now permanently housed in a giant mobile sarcophagus with two powerful claws, a flamethrower, and a chain gun. Due to the Dreadnought's mechanical nature, Thule doesn't heal naturally like the other squads and does not benefit from the stimulant pack; he must instead be healed manually by another squad wielding a repair kit. He has vehicle armor, making most combatants ineffective against him, save those with missile launcher and other anti-vehicle weaponry; as they are capable of doing severe damage to him while he plods through the ranks spinning around and crushing his opponents to death.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players are rewarded with wargear during missions, which then carry over into subsequent battles. Players will also earn skill points which they can use to level up attributes of their squad leaders, unlocking special powers and abilities.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">Matches in multiplayer can be Team Battle, Head to Head, or Two on Two. A Team Battle pits two teams of up to three players or CPU's against each other. A Head to Head match is a match between you and one other player, either CPU or Human. A Two on Two battle is two teams of two players or CPU's against each other.<\/p><h3>Game Types<\/h3><ul><li>Victory Points - You can win the game by capturing Victory Points. The team that controls the most victory points will run down the opposing team's Victory Counter. Win the game by running the enemy Victory Counter down to zero points.<\/li><li>Annihilate - You can take the fight directly to you opponents and destroy their bases. If you eliminate all enemy bases, you will win the match.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Resources<\/h3><p style=\"\">You will requisition and power to purchase units and upgrades for your army. Capture points on the map to increase the amounts of requistion and power you are earning.<\/p><ul><li><b>Requistion<\/b> - Requistion is the primary resource used for purchasing units. Be sure to capture requistion points.<\/li><li><b>Power<\/b> - Power is required for advanced units and upgrades. Capture Power nodes to increase your Power income. You can upgrade the Power Nodes and build up to three generators at them to generate even more resources for you and your team.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Factions<\/h2><p style=\"\">Four factions have been announced for the game so far, with the Tyranids being a new race to the Dawn of War series. The single player game follows a Space Marines campaign, whilst the multiplayer game will allow you to play any one of the factions.<\/p><h3>Space Marines<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3886\/841339-dawn_of_war_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-841339\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3886\/841339-dawn_of_war_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-841339\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3886\/841339-dawn_of_war_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Space Marines<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><i>\"With this and Faith, I am unstoppable!\"<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\">Mankind's most powerful and feared warriors.

Even though they use ramshackle and slapped-together equipment, they still manage to be a great force in the galaxy through sheer toughness, fearlessness and numbers.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><h3><i>Commanders<\/i><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/1104842-fullscreen_capture_8112009_75913_pm.bmp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104842\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/1104842-fullscreen_capture_8112009_75913_pm.bmp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104842\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/1104842-fullscreen_capture_8112009_75913_pm.bmp.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Warboss<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li><b>Kommando<\/b><br\/>The Kommando is a stealth expert that ambushes his prey.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Mekboy<\/b><br\/>Meks are responsible for maintaining the machinery that the Orks use.

This has been the biggest update yet introducing a number of balance fixes. The patch focused on re-balancing and\/or re-purposing units with a higher emphasis on Tier I combat. This change will allow Tier I units to stay relevant in mid-late game instead of rushing to Tier II as soon as possible.<\/p><p style=\"\">They have also added a number of new features including:<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\"><b>World Builder<\/b><br\/>\u2022 Added the World Builder how-to guide to the root directory<br\/>\u2022 Fixed a bug where adding a horizon-mesh would cause World Builder to crash<\/p><\/blockquote><blockquote><p style=\"\"><b>Observer Feature<\/b><br\/>\u2022 Pressing ESC now gets rid of the observer\/replay attention arrow.

Exactly three players (Heroes may be repeated) position themselves around a map and fight wave after wave of Tyranids, Orks, Eldar and Space Marines, while trying to survive and score as high as possible. The map has two strategic locations that increase the party's Score Multiplier and enemies will try to capture them. If a Hero falls in battle, he remains incapacitated until one of his teammates revives him. The game ends when all three Heroes are incapacitated at the same time. When the game ends, a screen displays an overview of the players's stats for that game (number of kills, deaths, etc) and the players are awarded equal experience depending on how far they got.<\/p><p style=\"\">Levelling up in The Last Stand does not strictly increase a Hero's stats, but instead gives them new Wargear that they can equip to give them certain traits (passive) or abilities (active). For example, the Ork Mekboy receives \"Electric Armor\" at level 18, which has a higher Armor Rating than his starting armor and grants him the \"Damage Aura\" trait which damages all nearby enemies. The Eldar Farseer, on the other hand, starts off with the \"Pistol of the Doomseer\" which grants the \"Eldritch Bolt\" ability, which deals huge damage to a large area of enemies at the cost of Energy. After about the 4th wave, each new wave is vastly more difficult than the previous one and players will likely fall if they are not properly equipped and do not work together.<\/p><h3>Elite Status<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4660\/1269623-elite_token.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269623\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4660\/1269623-elite_token.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269623\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4660\/1269623-elite_token.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Elite Token<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After getting a hero to level 20, the player has an option to upgrade that hero to \"Elite Status\". When the player chooses this option, the hero's level is reverted to 1 and an Elite Token is placed in their inventory. This requires the player to grind back up to level 20 to get all the Wargear again, but gives any players seeking a high score an advantage.<\/p><p style=\"\">The first time a hero is upgraded, the player receives an Elite Token commander item. This token must take the place of an otherwise useful normal commander item. It grants the team a 5% increase in points scored when equipped. Upgrading the hero's status a second time resets the hero's level again and grants an accessory token. This must take the place of an otherwise useful normal accessory, and grants 3% increase in points scored when equipped.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Hero: Space Marine Captain<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4660\/1265910-sm_captain_banner.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1265910\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4660\/1265910-sm_captain_banner.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1265910\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4660\/1265910-sm_captain_banner.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Space Marine Captain<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Space Marine Captain is a powerful hero that excels in aggressively taking the fight to the enemy.

It was nominated for two awards and won the award for \"Excellence in Visual Art\". Following the awards, <a href=\"\/phil-fish\/3040-100988\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100988\">Phil Fish<\/a>, the mastermind behind Fez created \"Polytron Corporation\" as a banner under which he would develop and release the game.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p style=\"\">In <i>Indie Game: The Movie<\/i>, Fish talked about his five year struggle with trying to maintain Polytron Corporation by himself after his lead sound designer Jason DeGroot left. When showing the game at PAX Prime 2011, Fish risked a lawsuit with his former business partner due to unsettled royalty disputes. During development, Fez was completely remade three times due to lack of funding. The game was given an (ironic) release date of Friday the 13th of 2012. At the <i>Indie Game: The Movie<\/i> premiere, Fish stated that he currently has no plans to bring Fez to any other platform, but will consider doing so if the game sells well.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\">A PC version of Fez was released on May 1, 2013 (<a href=\"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/224760\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steam page<\/a>). Like the XBLA version, it's listed as being developed by Polytron and published by Trapdoor.<\/p><p style=\"\">At Gamescom 2013, it was announced that Fez will come to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/gomez\/3005-9607\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9607\">Gomez<\/a> receives a letter, from a mysterious man with an <a href=\"\/eyepatch\/3055-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-94\">eyepatch<\/a>, telling him to meet him at the top of his town, when he arrives a mysterious object appears in the sky; a cube. Gomez suddenly gains the ability to rotate the 2D world in which he lives, and must collect cubes and their counterpart, anti-cubes.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10652\/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1617998\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10652\/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1617998\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/10652\/1617998-fez_p.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Gomez's room in 2D.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As a puzzle-platformer, Fez gameplay is primarily map traversal, discovery, and item collection. Gomez can innately walk, jump, climb, ledge grab, drop through ledges, push, pick up, and throw items. During the opening sequence he gains the ability to rotate the perceived 2D world in 90 degree increments, around the vertical (Y) axis of the screen. This reveals that the environment is fully 3D in nature. Despite the ability to traverse multiple planes, Gomez can only move and interact with the 2D plane relative to the player, and will always migrate to the foreground layer when possible. For example, he cannot enter a doorway from the side, or when a background passage is obscured by a foreground object \u2013 even if Gomez is standing between them. He appears shadowed when in the background layer, and a silhouette when completely obscured behind the environment. (If you listen carefully, the music also becomes muffled.)<\/p><p style=\"\">Gomez has no health meter, and upon death (by fall or otherwise) he will immediately respawn on the last stable platform he stood on. He also retains momentum relative to the world while it is rotated: jumping to the right and then rotating 180 degrees will continue the momentum to the left, but rotating 90 degrees will stop all forward motion.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13158\/839153-gb.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-839153\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13158\/839153-gb.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-839153\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/13158\/839153-gb.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Gomez can rotate the world to reveal new perspectives.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">There are 64 cubes to collect in total - 32 Gold Cubes and 32 Blue Anti-Cubes. As well as being able to find cubes throughout the world, cube bits can be collected throughout the game and once 8 cube bits are found they create 1 cube. Anti-cubes are generally more difficult to obtain, requiring puzzle solving rather than standard platforming. Some puzzles involve deciphering glyphs and following their instructions. Others are rhythm puzzles, where the controller vibrates and a rotational direction correlates to the sound the controller makes while it vibrates.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once the ending kill screen is reached, you can then start a New Game + after the credits and gain the ability to view the world from a first person perspective. Certain puzzles require use of the first person view in order to complete them. New Game + also unlocks the ability to fly (to activate press up four times and then hold A). Once the game is completed a second time, a stereoscopic 3D option is unlocked.<\/p><h2>Environment<\/h2><p style=\"\">The world of Fez consists of several areas which appear normal, but may contain physics-defying characteristics even beyond Gomez's abilities. For example, some maps scroll infinitely up and down in an endless loop. Others have an infinite cycle of passages or use doors to teleport to far away islands.<\/p><h3>World Map<\/h3><p style=\"\">The world map is an intricate and complex 3D tree of branching locations. Every level and room in the game is a separate \"area\", represented as a hexagonal cell. When an area is explored, the map cell indicates what items and secrets remain to be discovered. When all secrets within a single area are discovered, the thumbnail and border of that map cell acquires a gold sheen.<\/p><h3>Warping<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are several hub areas within Fez, and cubic warp gates link them together once discovered and activated. Smaller square warp gates transport Gomez back to the start of an area, and save the player an excessive amount of backtracking. Simpler, shortcut doors also open up specific routes between areas once the entrance is discovered and unlocked.<\/p><h3>Hazards<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/falling-damage\/3015-2510\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2510\">Falling<\/a> \u2013 Gomez can fall approximately 8 blocks before the drop will automatically kill him, unless he lands in water.

These totems must be interacted with and backtracked to, in order to access all sides of an area.<\/li><li>Water \u2013 Gomez is a buoyant swimmer and can jump out of water with no loss of height. <a href=\"\/water-that-damages-the-player\/3015-3841\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3841\">Hazardous water<\/a> will kill him instantly.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Items<\/h2><h3>Artifacts<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are four artifacts hidden around the world in Fez.

Numbers correlate to the open spaces in each square (if you're looking at the white, negative space). One equals an open space on the top of the square. Two equals an open space on the right of the square. Three equals and open space at the bottom of the square. Four equals an open space the the left side of the square. If you look at the chart on the right, you'll see that the number three can also be represent with an open space on the top and on the right; or, in other words, 1 + 2 = 3.<\/p><h3>Code<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/15\/156864\/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183323\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/15\/156864\/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183323\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/15\/156864\/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">There are glyphs composed of <a href=\"\/tetromino\/3055-1722\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1722\">tetrominos<\/a> which represent controller inputs.

On the Console versions,\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0 Certain maps are marked as 'Unbalanced\", these maps are referred to as such because they are designed in such a way that one team is put at a disadvantage, consistently, regardless of whos playing.\u00a0<br\/><i>* Players could play in a match and on the PC version up to 64 may play at one time. <\/i><br\/><br\/><h3>Maps<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32508\/939455-shot0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-939455\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/32508\/939455-shot0009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-939455\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/32508\/939455-shot0009.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Map created using mod tools<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Carentan, France- French Village, Americans, Germans<\/li><li>Rostov, Russia- Russian Port, disliked by the majority of COD players, because it tends to be unbalanced towards the German Side.

Both the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 version have basic compatibility with Rock Band instruments. However, unlike in Rock Band, you cannot use a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3669\" href=\"\/headset\/3055-3669\/\" slug=\"headset\">headset<\/a> to sing vocals.<\/p><p style=\"\">Guitar Hero: World Tour's soundtrack includes songs from Van Halen, Linkin Park, The Eagles, Sublime, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-56559\" href=\"\/lenny-kravitz\/3040-56559\/\" slug=\"lenny-kravitz\">Lenny Kravitz<\/a>, and more. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there are no cover songs in the game--every track is from the original artist. The game also has a music studio mode where players can construct new tracks. It supports online play for many of its modes such as band career mode, where the player can recruit friends to form a band and play online or on the same console and fight other bands in a new Battle of the Bands mode. It also allows players to complete the single-player career mode as any of the four instruments. To encourage families playing together a new \"Easy Rhythm\" difficulty has been added so that parents can play with their kids. This mode removes the necessity to worry about hitting the correct fret or drum pad and instead just focuses on having the player strum or hit a pad at the right rhythm.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/597\/181057-instruments.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181057\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/597\/181057-instruments.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181057\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/597\/181057-instruments.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Guitar Hero: World Tour instruments<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">There are several new gameplay addition new to Guitar Hero (and to full band games in general). For the bass guitar there is a new open strum note, effectively a \"sixth button\" to make bass more interesting. Like a bass pedal kick, this is signified on-screen by a horizontal line across the fretboard. Drums have \"sustained\" cymbal notes, which act as cymbal rolls without the precision required of drums rolls. Drums are also be able to activate starpower by hitting both cymbals at the same time at any point during a song. There are also drums notes that one must hit with above average force to gain maximum points, taking advantage of the velocity sensitive drum pads. Lead Guitar has tapping sections like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"\/rock-band\/3025-567\/\" slug=\"rock-band\">Rock Band<\/a>, that can be performed on both the normal fret buttons or the slide strip.

Peggle combines game mechanics from the Japanese casino game <a href=\"\/pachinko\/3030-4425\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4425\">Pachinko<\/a> and the 1976 <a href=\"\/atari-inc\/3010-182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari<\/a> arcade game <a href=\"\/breakout\/3030-13049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\">Breakout<\/a>. The gameplay of Peggle consists of players firing balls from the top of the stage at multi-colored pegs. When a ball contacts a peg, said peg lights up and is added to a combo meter. As the ball continues to bounce around the play area and hit more pegs the player receives more points. A turn is ended when the ball either falls through the bottom of the stage, or is caught by an osculating bucket and thus saved for reuse.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Essentially the game of Pachinko, Peggle asks the player to clear out all the orange pegs on any one board. Blue Pegs exists to aid your score, and there are a couple other colors as well (see below) To complete each stage you get 10 balls, however there are a couple ways earn extra balls. You could either A) Earn enough points in one shot B) Hit your ball into a moving bucket at the bottom of the screen or C) a combination of both. In addition if your ball does not hit a peg it will trigger a coin toss that could result in you getting a redo.<\/p><h3>Types of Pegs<\/h3><p style=\"\">In Peggle Deluxe there are four different types of pegs. The orange peg is the object peg. In most instances a player will need to strike all oranges pegs to advance. The blue peg is a point peg, each blue peg you hit will add to your combo and score. Green pegs are power-up pegs. These pegs allow you use of the selected characters ability. Finally purple pegs are score point boost pegs that increase the number of points you get for each peg that the ball contacts <i>after<\/i> hitting the purple one.<\/p><h3>Modes of Play<\/h3><p style=\"\">Peggle Deluxe has 4 modes of play. These modes are:<\/p><ul><li>Adventure<\/li><li>Quick Play<\/li><li>Duel<\/li><li>Challenge<\/li><\/ul><h3>Adventure Mode<\/h3><p style=\"\">Adventure mode is where most new players will start learning the game's mechanics and is set up to take you though each of the game's boards and <a href=\"\/power-up\/3015-700\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power ups<\/a>. Adventure mode is divided into stages and levels. There are 10 stages and 5 levels to each stage. The object of level in Adventure Mode is simple, you must use your balls to hit all of the orange pegs, and you have ten balls to complete this task. Before each stage you are introduced to a new character via a small intro paragraph and picture. Each character has their own unique power-up that can be used to help players completed the levels.<\/p><p style=\"\">The stages and levels are as follows:<\/p><h4>Stage One: Bjorn<\/h4><figure

Critics cite its addictive nature and \"feel-good\" moments as strengths. It has a Metacritic score of 92, which is extremely high for a cheap, download only game. Even the usually harsh <a href=\"\/ben-croshaw\/3040-89641\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89641\">Yahtzee<\/a> said that \"I started playing around noon and emerged from my room sometime later to find the authorities had declared me legally dead\" in reference to how addictive the gameplay was. PC Zone Magazine called Peggle \"Addictive and happy\", which seemed to be a pretty good sum-up of the general reception.<\/p><h2>System Requirements<\/h2><h3>PC<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 2000\/XP\/Vista\/7\/8<\/li><li><strong>CPU:<\/strong> 600 Mhz<\/li><li><strong>RAM:<\/strong> 128 MB<\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> 6.0<\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive: <\/strong>21 MB<\/li><\/ul><h3>Mac<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS: <\/strong>OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66<\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 512 MB of RAM<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"> <\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1381532-peggle_box.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1381532-peggle_box.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1381532-peggle_box.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1381532-peggle_box.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1381532-peggle_box.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1381532-peggle_box.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1381532-peggle_box.png"},"name":"Peggle"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Spit\/Second is a racing game based on a fictional reality show for stunt drivers inspired by the explosive styling of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. The player must qualify to appear in the next 'episode', and finally to become the 'season' champion. The game is also known as Split\/Second Velocity in other regions of the world (like Europe).<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The player races around a \"fake\" made for TV city that is rigged with explosives. The game's tutorial is a casting call where you must qualify for the show and the game's opening cinematic shows you the different sets being made. The game pitches the show as a massively popular one that'll be watched by billions.<\/p><p style=\"\">As to keep with the illusion that you're taking part in a TV show, the game is split up into 12 different episodes each with their own theme. At the end of each episode, the game gives you a short promo of the next one while the \"fake\" credits roll. The game also has the BRTV (Black Rock TV) logo on the top right corner of the screen.<\/p><h3>Season Mode<\/h3><p style=\"\">Season mode is the game's \"story\" mode and is divided into 12 different episodes. In each episode, you have to complete to move on (see Race Types). Winning each event nets you credits and once you have enough credits you unlock the Elite Race. The Elite Race is the last of the six event and is championship that goes on through the entire Season Mode. According to your rank at the end of the race, you win a certain number of points. At the end of each episode there is an Elite Race and you must rank well enough to be number one by the end of the season. You must complete this race in order to get to the next episode.<\/p><p style=\"\">During an episode, there is always one race that is locked : the Bonus Round. To unlock this race, you must do certain things like wreck a certain number of opponents. The Bonus Round lets you get even more credits that are automatically used to get new cars and unlock the next Elite Race. Once you've completed an episode, the game lets you chose what episode you want to play next.<\/p><h3>Power Plays<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39552\/1204648-2009_12_02_042319_1920x1080_scrot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1204648\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39552\/1204648-2009_12_02_042319_1920x1080_scrot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1204648\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/39552\/1204648-2009_12_02_042319_1920x1080_scrot.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Decisions, decisions... What shall I blow up first?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Drifting, drafting and overtaking nets the player power, which is in turn added to the distinctive, semi-circular power bar. When one of the three segments is full, the player can activate a Power Play. Depending on the amount of power earned, the effect of the Power Play differs. Earning more segments increases the effect on the environment and opponents.<\/p><p style=\"\">Some Power Plays are purely offensive in use, causing explosions and mayhem to take out your opponents. Power Plays can also open shortcuts temporarily, allowing the player to shave seconds off the lap time or gain position in the race. However, once a Power Play meter is filled to its maximum, significant changes to the track can be made through massive destruction of the environment, altering the course for the remainder of the race.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game tells you when you can use a Power Play on an opponent and the color of the icon over the other cars indicates what kind of Power Play you are about to trigger (blue is a levels 1 Power Play while Bordeaux colored ones are level 2 Power Plays). You can be destroyed by your own Power Play and a Power Play used against an opponents car isn't guaranteed to hit which means that there is a certain amount of timing involved. When your timing is perfect, the game can zoom in slow motion to show you the wreck or can offer you to watch the crash again as an action replay. Sometimes your Power Play wrecks an opponent indirectly (The blast of the explosion can send a car flying out of control and into a wall).<\/p><p style=\"\">Power Plays can sometimes be used multiple times on the same object. For example, in one of the construction site tracks you pass next to a building that is in construction. The first time you use a Power Play on it, it triggers an explosion and part of the top of the building starts hanging off. The second time, the top bit falls and creates ramp. The third time, the entire building falls on its side and the cars must pass under it.<\/p><p style=\"\">Sometimes, to show you just how powerful the Power Play is, the game music cuts off to let you hear the blast of what is happening.<\/p><h3>HUD<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39552\/1051189-splitsecond13.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1051189\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/39552\/1051189-splitsecond13.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1051189\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/39552\/1051189-splitsecond13.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Split\/Second's unique HUD<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-180\" href=\"\/heads-up-display\/3015-180\/\" slug=\"heads-up-display\">heads-up-display<\/a> is designed in a unique way, as all related track information (position, laps, power play level) appear around your car as you are racing so that you don't have to look up in the corners and risk crashing and there is better visibility so you can see every detail of the massive destruction around you. The HUD also tells you when you can activate a Power Play on the enemy in front of you.<\/p><h2>Race Types<\/h2><p style=\"\">Split\/Second has different race modes. Each race mode is automatically unlocked in quickplay after completing it in the career.<\/p><h3>Race<\/h3><p style=\"\">The classic race type. You must do laps around the track and try to come in first. To help you do this, you can use your Power Plays to destroy your opponents.<\/p><h3>Detonator<\/h3><p style=\"\">Time attack with a twist. You must do a lap around the track, trying to beat a certain time with a car that the game chooses for you. While you're trying to do your lap, the game starts triggering Power Plays against you. A good knowledge of the track and where the Power Plays are is required to succeed.<\/p><h3>Elimination<\/h3><p style=\"\">The car in last place is disqualified after each countdown. The first countdown starts at 50 seconds and once that countdown is finished, the other ones last 20 seconds each until only one car remains. Power Plays are on during this event and there is an achievement\/trophy that requires you to pass an opponent when there is only one second left on the countdown.<\/p><h3>Survival<\/h3><p style=\"\">In this game mode you must dodge explosive barrels that are thrown at you from the back of a big rig. You win points by passing a big rig and for every third big rig you pass, you increase your multiplier. The trucks throw different kinds of barrels at you: blue barrels damage your car while red barrels are an automatic crash. Getting hit by multiple blue barrels at the same time will make your car crash. Your goal is to get a high score before the timer runs out. Once the timer does run out, the game goes into sudden death where one crash means an automatic game over.<\/p><h3>Helicopter Attack<\/h3><p style=\"\">You must dodge each wave of missiles fired from a helicopter. The game shows you where the missiles will land and you must do your best to dodge them. You earn points after passing each wave, the number of points depending if you got partially hit by a missile or not (perfect wave). You have three lives to complete the event and after every three waves, your multiplier increases. Going to slowly will result in automatic elimination.<\/p><h3>Helicopter Revenge<\/h3><p style=\"\">This is your chance to get back at the helicopter. As always, he fires missiles at you that you must dodge. After completing a wave, you get to fire a missile back at the helicopter. You must do this under a certain time and the event ends once the helicopter's life bar is reduced to zero or that the timer runs out.<\/p><h2>Vehicles<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are no licensed cars appearing in Split\/Second, rather the team has designed their own <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5156\" href=\"\/fictional-car-brands\/3015-5156\/\" slug=\"fictional-car-brands\">fictional<\/a> car brands that are unlockable over the entirety of the game's mode selections, rewarding the player with new vehicles however they play. The cars are either unlocked by progression (like getting to the next level) or credits that are awarded to you at the end of each race. You can also download an add-on for the game that will unlock all the cars. Each car has different stats and some cars are better for certain situations then others. For example, the pick-ups have slow acceleration but good speed and they are tough meaning that they are less likely to go crashing out of control after getting hit by a Power Play.<\/p><table

Split\/Second<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Tracks are heavily influenced by action movies set pieces and chases rather than specific locations, with the emphasis being on environmental hazards and dynamic track deformation. The tracks are littered with different <a data-ref-id=\"3015-609\" href=\"\/traps\/3015-609\/\" slug=\"traps\">booby traps<\/a> and aids that the players can trigger during the race through the use of a 'Power Play'. Along with these are other various traps and features that can either help or hurt the player. For example, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-361\" href=\"\/helicopter\/3055-361\/\" slug=\"helicopter\">helicopters<\/a> flying overhead can drop <a data-ref-id=\"3055-97\" href=\"\/bomb\/3055-97\/\" slug=\"bomb\">bombs<\/a> on opponents while a gas station might explode as you drive past it.<\/p><p style=\"\">Race Mode Tracks include:<\/p><ul><li>Airport Terminal<\/li><li>Downtown Central<\/li><li>Construction Site<\/li><li>Port Bridge<\/li><li>Ferry Wharf<\/li><li>Dry Docks<\/li><li>Expressway<\/li><li>Airplane Graveyard<\/li><li>Storm Drain<\/li><li>Power Plant<\/li><li>Canyon<\/li><li>Quarry (Onslaught DLC)<\/li><\/ul><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">Split\/Second has both online and offline split-screen multiplayer modes. Online pits you against 7 other racers in all the race modes that are found offline (except helicopter attack and revenge). Split\/Second has a rank system. You start at an online form of 99 and your goal is to get all the way down to 1. To improve your form, you must place in the top half (4th or higher in an 8-player lobby, 3rd or higher in a 6-player lobby, etc.). The game lets you play in ranked matches a well as private. In the lobby, the game lets you know how powerful their car is and what rank they're currently on. Like in single player, you can use Power Plays on your online friends and foes and can also use the cars that you've unlocked in offline modes. The game also offers a two player split-screen mode that's the same as the online mode except with no leveling up.<\/p><h2>DLC<\/h2><p style=\"\">Split\/Second had day one DLC packs. These packs let you unlock all the cars and tracks in the game and came at a price. The developers later announced 4 other DLC packs that would provide new content.<\/p><p style=\"\">The first pack brings super charged cars that are supposed to give you the edge on your opponents. The second pack, named \"High Octane Super Car Pack\", also provides new high speed vehicles. The third pack is free, a gift to players and features a car similar to the Ryback Cyclone.<\/p><p style=\"\">On October 12th (11th for PSN) the \"Survival at the Rock\" DLC pack was released for both PS3 and 360 at a price of $6.99 or 560 Microsoft points. It is 281MB and comes with an all new track: Minepit Park Quarry. Like other Split\/Second tracks, the Minepit is rigged with explosives that you can detonate against your enemies. The pack also comes with 3 new cars and the Ryback Coyote special. Also included is a new survival level on the Minepit track where you must dodge exploding barrels being thrown out of a big rig.<\/p><p style=\"\">On October 19th (18th for PSN) the \"Deadline pack\" DLC was released for PS3 and 360 for for 4.99$ or 400 Microsoft points. This pack introduced a new game mode called Deadline. The player must race around the track while a timer ticks down. To freeze the timer, you must drift to pick up power ups that freeze it. The DLC also comes with 4 new cars.<\/p><p style=\"\">In early November, the \"Quarry Onslaught\" pack was released: first for the 360 on November 2nd at a price of 800 Microsoft points, then on November 8th for the PS3 at $9.99. This pack included the new Quarry track that can be played in any game mode and the new Onslaught mode, which is similar to Airstrike, but with multiple cars.<\/p><h2>E3 2009<\/h2><p style=\"\">Split\/Second was demoed during <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3244\" href=\"\/e3-2009\/3015-3244\/\" slug=\"e3-2009\">E3 2009<\/a>. In the demo, the player was racing through an airport. Throughout the race, the player revealed shortcuts, destroyed an entire bridge, caused a communications tower to collapse, and even dodged a large jet that skidded across the track. The other level shown at E3 was the docks. The HUD showed the racing info displayed on and under the car's bumper.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>You can tilt the game's menu screens with the right stick.<\/li><li>The achievements and trophies that you've won are used as decals on your car.<\/li><li>Staying on a certain car in the car select screen for a long time triggers a cutscene of the car.<\/li><li>All cars resemble licensed cars.<\/li><li>There is an unlockable car (the Class C \"Ryback Mohawk XDX\") with a <a href=\"http:\/\/disneyxd.disney.co.uk\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disney XD<\/a> skin and minor performance tweaks, apparently due to the developer\/publisher relationship between <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1312\" href=\"\/disney-interactive-studios\/3010-1312\/\" slug=\"disney-interactive-studios\">Disney Interactive Studios<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6353\" href=\"\/black-rock-studio\/3010-6353\/\" slug=\"black-rock-studio\">Black Rock Studios<\/a>.

Once you've finished the game's season mode, the announcer congratulates you as your car proudly stands on the podium. Suddenly, everything around the podium starts blowing up. The game show host makes it clear that this wasn't planned, and realizes that those responsible are a group of people who were part of a show that was cancelled in the 80s.

Players start by picking a character class and then progress through quests, earning money, experience, and equipment in the process. Unlike the original, weapon proficiency is not based on class. Defeating enemies earns experience points and loot in the form of weapons, ammunition, grenade mods, shields, etc. Loot is also available in a variety of chests, safes, cabinets, lockers, and refuse piles. Borderlands 2 uses a randomization system to generate loot.<\/p><p style=\"\">Characters have separate health and shield values; should the player's shield deplete and health reach zero, he or she will enter \"Fight for your Life\" mode. In this mode, players are given a short period of time to kill an enemy and gain a \"second wind.\" In solo play, players must kill an enemy to continue; in co-op play, they must kill someone <i>or<\/i> must be revived by a teammate. Co-op players get more time to survive\/be revived. Without a kill or help from a teammate, the character dies and respawns at the last save point. Hyperion Corporation also charges the player a percentage of their money for the privilege of respawning, with an occasionally snarky voiceover. If the player is very low on funds the fee will be waived.<\/p><p style=\"\">As players gain experience and level up, they can distribute skill points to the current character. Each class has a unique action skill and three skill trees loosely organized around a particular style of play. Each increase in level also brings an increase to health and damage dealt, and a decrease to damage received. The level cap is currently set at 50 but, as with the original game, the cap may be raised later by <a href=\"\/downloadable-content\/3015-329\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\" data-mce-href=\"\/downloadable-content\/3015-329\/\">Downloadable Content<\/a>. Once players complete the first playthrough with a characters, they have the option of using the character in True Vault Hunter mode, basically a new playthrough with tougher enemies and better loot. After completing the second playthrough, a third, or playthrough 2.5 is entered, where enemies and loot scale up to level 50.<\/p><p style=\"\">Announced at Gearbox's PAX East 2013 panel, with the help of a $5 (400 MSP) add-on for the title (unless one has the season pass), those who are maxed out at level 50 will be able to level up to 61. Additionally, Pearlescent weapon types, a set of rare finds in <a href=\"\/borderlands\/3030-20487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" data-mce-href=\"\/borderlands\/3030-20487\/\">Borderlands<\/a>, would populate the sequel with possible drops.<\/p><h4>Badass Ranks<\/h4><p style=\"\">Yet another new addition to Borderlands 2 is a system called badass ranks. The player may complete ingame challenges, like killing a certain amount of enemies with a shotgun, or scoring critical hits with a sniper rifle or finding vault symbols at given locations and many other challenges. The challenges are grouped into several tiers. The 1st tier gives 1 badass rank, the 2nd 5, the 3rd 10, 4th 50, and the 5th 100. Once enough badass ranks are attained the player gains a token that can be used on improving various statistics, like critical hit damage, gun damage, shield capacity, maximum health and so on. These improvements are rather small, with diminishing returns on several upgrades, but the badass rank system has infinite levels. The badass rank (along with the improvements) are carried out to all characters. And every new character created by the player starts with all the challenges reset, thus allowing the player to acquire an infinite number of badass ranks and therefor badass tokens. Due to a player being able to theoretically gain a huge advantage with improvements from tokens, Gearbox added the option of turning off the improved statistics so that the game wouldn't be too easy.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players can buy new equipment and sell unwanted equipment at the numerous vending machines located throughout Pandora. The items on offer will depend on the location of the vending machine, <i>not<\/i> character level, with the exception of vending machines in Sanctuary, which do scale by level. Each type of vending machine sells certain types of equipment, as follows:<\/p><ul><li>Weapon Vending Machines - sells only weapons;<\/li><li>Ammunition Vending Machines - sells ammo and grenade mods;<\/li><li>Medical Vending Machines - sells shields, class mods, artifacts, and health regenerating items.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">A new addition to Borderlands 2 is the Black Market run by Crazy Earl. There the player can buy upgrades (backpack slots, bank slots, maximum ammo limits) in exchange for refined eridium.<\/p><p style=\"\">Borderlands 2 offers vastly improved character customization options. In the first game, players could only choose basic clothing colors and character names. Borderlands 2 features a wider variety of color schemes, as well as distinctive head wear that can be found in shops, loot drops, slot machines, and by completing quests. Unlocked color schemes and specific headwear apply only to the active character, although a character may find skins and headwear for other classes. Vehicles also have distinct skins and collectable customization mods.<\/p><p style=\"\">Borderlands 2 features split-screen for all platforms. Local and online co-op may be combined, so that two players can play split-screen locally with two other online friends. However, only two players may play in split-screen at any given time, as the game requires one person to be the host. The host cannot play split-screen due to the CPU burden.<\/p><h3>Missions<\/h3><p style=\"\">Borderlands 2 features an <a href=\"..\/..\/open-world\/92-207\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"..\/..\/open-world\/92-207\/\">open world<\/a> with main and side missions provided by various NPCs and bounty boards. Some missions include an optional objective, such as killing a certain NPC with a certain weapon, or killing x number of bandits. The completion of side missions and optional objectives leads to the completion of challenges.<\/p><h3>Transportation<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167580\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167580\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/39\/2167580-interlude_technical.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Much like the original, the game features vehicular combat.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The player can use vehicles or fast travel or a combination of both in order to traverse the world in a speedy manner. Like the original there is a fast travel system as well as vehicles. Vehicles have a turbo boost, that increases the speed at which the vehicle travels. Unlike the first game, vehicles no longer have shields, but just a general amount of hit points, and once depleted the vehicle will explode leading to all characters who were garrisoned inside to go through second wind. In the first game the only vehicle available was the Runner, it has 2 seats, one for the driver and one for the gunner. In Borderlands 2, there will be several \"families\" of vehicles, for example Bandit Technical, or a Light Runner. There is a new feature that allows players to equip relics that improve a vehicles performance, thus increasing various statistics. Another feature is a more robust customization option, featuring many color schemes for different vehicles. As in the previous game players can access their vehicles through \" <i>Catch-A-Ride<\/i>\" that is run by <a href=\"\/scooter\/3005-13587\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13587\" data-mce-href=\"\/scooter\/3005-13587\/\">Scooter<\/a> along with his sister <a href=\"\/ellie\/3005-23816\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23816\" data-mce-href=\"\/ellie\/3005-23816\/\">Ellie<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is a new type of flying vehicle, that is unfortunately only available to enemies.<\/p><h3>Multiplayer options<\/h3><p style=\"\">Like the previous version Borderlands 2 will have options for <a href=\"\/cooperative-play\/3015-108\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\" data-mce-href=\"\/cooperative-play\/3015-108\/\">co-op play<\/a>. This can be done on using a LAN or online using an internet connection. The <a href=\"\/drop-in-drop-out\/3015-1553\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1553\" data-mce-href=\"\/drop-in-drop-out\/3015-1553\/\">drop-in\\drop-out<\/a> option is again available for players to join a running game instantly. You can play with up to three <a href=\"\/4-player-co-op\/3015-2563\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2563\" data-mce-href=\"\/4-player-co-op\/3015-2563\/\">friends in a co-op game<\/a>. You can also challenge your friends to a duel.<\/p><p style=\"\">Trading equipment between players is now friendlier than ever. When both players want to exchange stuff, they both need to press the exchange buttons and can then offer weapons, ammo and other equipment to each other. You pay with another weapon or equipment and can add extra money if needed. When both parties agree, the deal is done.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p style=\"\">Weapons played a big role in the original game, this is true for Borderlands 2 as well. Weapons, like enemies and characters, have a level, this determines their stats. As the players gain levels they will find better, higher level weapons. Weapons dropped or found as loot are always random, in their appearance, quality and stats. However, there are certain unique weapons that are given to the player after certain quests, and legendary weapons that can drop from loot-able objects or defeated enemies. Weapons in Borderlands 2 have more variety, both in terms of their mechanics and appearance, when compared to the first game. An example would be a rocket launching assault rifle or a sniper rifle with 3 barrels that spin once fired for a faster fire rate. Weapons have several stats, and some even have a chance of inflicting elemental damage.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187150\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187150\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/12\/122249\/2187150-borderland_2_screenshot_2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The player using a scoped weapon to fight off a pack of enemies.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Weapon stats include:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/damage-numbers\/3015-2106\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2106\" data-mce-href=\"\/damage-numbers\/3015-2106\/\">Damage<\/a><\/li><li>Rate of Fire<\/li><li>Magazine Size<\/li><li>Reload Speed<\/li><li>Chance for Elemental Effects on Hit<\/li><li>Elemental Damage per Second<\/li><li>Value<\/li><li>Rarity<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Loot, weapons, and equipment have colored names to help identify their rarity - a feature seen in many other RPG titles:<\/p><ul><li><b>White<\/b> - average or common.<\/li><li><b>Green<\/b> - a little above average.<\/li><li><b>Blue<\/b> - uncommon.<\/li><li><b>Purple<\/b> - rare.<\/li><li><b>Orange\/Gold<\/b> - legendary.<\/li><li><strong>Pink <\/strong>- \"E-Tech\"<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Unique weapons that are given as quest rewards can never be white, legendary weapons can only be orange\/gold.<\/p><p style=\"\">The \"pearlescent\" quality weapons added to the first game by the Secret Armory Of <a href=\"..\/..\/general-knoxx\/94-14034\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"..\/..\/general-knoxx\/94-14034\/\">General Knoxx<\/a> won't be making a return in the base game.<\/p><p style=\"\">Apart from that, weapons can have certain abilities such as increasing damage, or firing speed, or magazine size etc. Weapons can also have an elemental modifier, that deal fire, shock, acid, or explosive damage. A new elemental modifier is slag, which covers an enemy in a purple goo-like substance that directly increases the damage other elemental modifiers do. Some items also have extra bonuses for equipping other items, or having multiple players equipping the same item.<\/p><p style=\"\">The players can choose from <a href=\"\/shotgun\/3055-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" data-mce-href=\"\/shotgun\/3055-114\/\">shotguns<\/a>, semi automatic <a href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\" data-mce-href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\">pistols<\/a> (revolvers are no longer separated into a different category), assault rifles, <a href=\"\/rocket-launcher\/3055-211\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" data-mce-href=\"\/rocket-launcher\/3055-211\/\">rocket launchers<\/a>, SMGs, and <a href=\"\/sniper-rifle\/3055-67\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" data-mce-href=\"\/sniper-rifle\/3055-67\/\">sniper rifles<\/a>. Eridian Weapons do not reappear, although there's a new weapon type known as E-Tech that utilizes eridium. Each class has a specific <a href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\" data-mce-href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\">melee attack<\/a> (Zer0 has a <a href=\"\/sword\/3055-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\" data-mce-href=\"\/sword\/3055-1\/\">sword<\/a>), which cannot be changed but can be upgraded through the bloodshed skill tree. The damage done also increases with higher levels. A good way of finding weapons is to loot weapon <a href=\"\/treasure-chest\/3055-517\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-517\" data-mce-href=\"\/treasure-chest\/3055-517\/\">chests<\/a>, finding a weapon is guaranteed, but the type of weapon as well as its stats, appearance and level are random. One new addition to gameplay allows Tediore weapons to be thrown as explosives once used, instead of reloaded, with damage done corresponding to the amount of ammo left in the clip when thrown\/reloaded. The gun re-digistructs in the players hand so they can continue to use that weapon.<\/p><h3>Weapon Manufacturers<\/h3><p style=\"\">The weapons of Borderlands 2 have distinct visual characteristics, allowing the player to recognize a gun's maker through sight alone. The game will feature different weapon manufacturers that design and produce all kinds of weapons, ranging from semi automatic pistols and revolvers to rocket launchers and heavy machine-guns.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/1862436-bandit600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862436\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/81005\/1862436-bandit600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862436\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/8\/81005\/1862436-bandit600.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Bandit weapon concept art.<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li><b>Bandit -<\/b> In the five years after the first game, bandits have taken to making their own weapons.

data-mce-href=\"..\/..\/pandora\/95-156\/\">Pandora<\/a>. <a href=\"..\/..\/handsome-jack\/94-20526\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"..\/..\/handsome-jack\/94-20526\/\">Handsome Jack<\/a>, the primary <a href=\"..\/..\/antagonist\/92-1070\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"..\/..\/antagonist\/92-1070\/\">antagonist<\/a>, has taken over the Hyperion Corporation and has ambitions to rule over all of Pandora. He is also claiming credit for discovering the vault and defeating the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-destroyer\/94-13545\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"..\/..\/the-destroyer\/94-13545\/\">Destroyer<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game starts off with four new vault hunters who are hired by Handsome Jack to discover a vault. Unfortunately Jack betrays them while they were traveling by train. The vault hunter manages to escape to a frozen part of Pandora where he encounters the last <a href=\"\/claptrap\/3015-4591\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4591\" data-mce-href=\"\/claptrap\/3015-4591\/\">Claptrap<\/a>. Claptrap, with help from the <a href=\"\/guardian-angel\/3005-14035\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14035\" data-mce-href=\"\/guardian-angel\/3005-14035\/\">Guardian Angel<\/a>, eventually leads the hunter to Sanctuary, the last free city on Pandora that bitterly opposes Jack and Hyperion.<\/p><p style=\"\">The city of Sanctuary is controlled by Crimson Raiders, a group that originated from the Crimson Lance. They are led by <a href=\"\/roland\/3005-11164\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11164\" data-mce-href=\"\/roland\/3005-11164\/\">Roland<\/a> who asks the vault hunter to help him defeat Jack. As it happens, Roland was captured by the Bloodshot bandit clan before the hunter could meet him in person, and so he was tasked with rescuing him. Along the way the vault hunter meets Firehawk - <a href=\"\/lilith\/3005-11162\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11162\" data-mce-href=\"\/lilith\/3005-11162\/\">Lilith<\/a> who has joined the fight against Jack, she reveals Roland's location but before he could be rescued Jack sends an army of robots to capture Roland from the bandits. Eventually, he is rescued from both the Bloodshot bandits and Hyperion robots. Once back in the Sanctuary, Roland shares the information he obtained on Jack's plan. While the Crimson Raiders knew that Jack plans on finding a vault; they didn't know he planned to control it. This particular vault isn't loaded with priceless resources, advanced alien weapons and it's not an alien prison. Rather, the vault is a living thing simply known as The Warrior. Whomever awakens it will control it; unfortunately Jack has the key. But the key is useless unless charged. It charges itself once in every two hundred years, but Jack can't wait that long. He needs a siren that can charge the key with eridium.<\/p><p style=\"\">The next step in the fight against Hyperion leads the hunter to the best sniper, spy and scout in the Crimson Raiders, <a href=\"\/mordecai\/3005-11163\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11163\" data-mce-href=\"\/mordecai\/3005-11163\/\">Mordecai<\/a>. He has information on the location of Jack's vault key, and the hunter's next objective is to ambush the train that holds it and take it. Explosives were needed for the job, and it leads him to the most skilled and deadly explosives expert on Pandora, a 13 year old girl named <a href=\"\/tiny-tina\/3005-23715\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23715\" data-mce-href=\"\/tiny-tina\/3005-23715\/\">Tiny Tina<\/a>. The vault hunter proceeds to attack the train en route and attempt to take the key. As it turns out the train was simply a trap, and the key wasn't there. Instead the hunter encounters Wilhelm, a ruthless robot and one of Jack's most powerful weapons. After dealing with the robot they take his power core, an advanced piece of Hyperion technology that can help Sanctuary's energy defense stay online indefinitely. Unfortunately the power core itself is yet another trap, and the Guardian Angel betrays everyone by helping Jack shut down the city's energy defenses. This leads to the bombardment of the city by Jack's H shaped space station that orbits Pandora. With the help of Lilith and her siren abilities, Scooter and the vault hunter, the city is teleported to another location. But due to Lilith's consumption of large amounts of eridium (which was needed for the process) the hunter was accidentally left behind, and he had to make his way towards the new location of Sanctuary.<\/p><p style=\"\">As the hunter makes his way to the new location, Angel attempts to explain herself to him. Once the vault hunter reaches Sanctuary, Angel informs everyone that the vault key is actually with her, but to get to it and thus prevent Jack from reaching the vault, resistance forces would have to pass a very difficult series of defenses set by Jack to secure the key. The first is a \"death wall\" entrance that leads to the bunker where the key is held. Only Hyperion personnel can pass through that entrance, for this task Claptrap had to be upgraded. The upgrade was actually supposed to be delivered by Bloodwing, but she got captured and it was up to the hunter to rescue her. Unfortunately Bloodwing was turned into a hideous giant monster through slag experimentation. Bloodwing could shapeshift into different elemental forms. The hunter weakened her and Mordecai attempted to tranquilize her, but Jack had explosives planted on her that he detonated as soon as the hunters took claptrap's upgrade located in Bloodwing's collar. The next challenge were Hyperion combat personnel and robots outfitted by the best equipment created by the same company, here <a href=\"\/brick\/3005-11161\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11161\" data-mce-href=\"\/brick\/3005-11161\/\">Brick<\/a> and his bandit clan, the Slabs, would help. Brick had a falling out with Roland 2 years after opening up the vault, Roland thought his methods to be too ruthless and bloodthirsty. So some convincing was needed to get Brick and his bandits to help. The last challenge was a door that only opens for Handsome Jack, for this the hunter had to kill Jack's double in Opportunity and record several examples of his voice in order to activate the door.<\/p><p style=\"\">After all preparations for this difficult undertaking were made, the hunter set out to the bunker. Finally after fighting many enemies with the help of Brick and his bandits, they made their way to the top of the bunker where they found out that it is not a simple building but that it is actually a giant flying robot (who Jack claims he designed himself). After defeating the robot the hunters make their way to Angel's inner chamber, there they see that Angel isn't just an AI but a Siren and Jack's daughter. She was trapped in her state and was fed eridium by Jack in the effort to find the vault. She tells the hunter that in order to defeat Jack, taking the key wouldn't be enough, he had to kill her. After a long battle with Hyperion robots and with the help of Roland and Lilith the hunter manages to destroy the eridium injectors, with many objections from Jack. Without those injectors Angel could not survive. As they succeed in their objective Jack teleports to them, kills Roland and captures Lilith.<\/p><p style=\"\">In light of these events the hunter returns to Sanctuary where he receives orders from Mordecai. Mordecai suggests that in order to defeat Jack once and for all, they'd have to find the vault In order to do so. However the vault hunter would have to access a Hyperion info stockade to get the location of the vault, and in order to get to the stockade he'd need very high grade explosives to breach the way. The info stockade is located in <a href=\"\/fyrestone\/3035-4172\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4172\" data-mce-href=\"\/fyrestone\/3035-4172\/\">Fyrestone<\/a>, now occupied by Hyperion forces. Once there the hunter learn that Jack has been transporting very large amounts of eridium to Hero's Pass. He leaves for Hero's Pass where, alongside Mordecai and Brick, fights a very large amount of Hyperion soldiers and robots. Brick and Mordecai are eventually overwhelmed and fall into lava. The vault hunter reachs The Vault of the Warrior, where he sees Jack for the second time in person. Before The Warrior is summoned the hunter fights Jack and defeats him.

The game features many alterations to the tried and true RTS formula, making the game feel more like how WW2 combat was conducted. Company of Heroes allows the player to assume command of either the Axis or Allied forces which more specifically depict the German Wehrmacht and the US troops. The two factions fight against each other in the game's multiplayer aspect--all Americans versus all Germans--but only the Allies are treated with a full single player campaign. Relic Online, the game's proprietary online service, is often updated with new patches that continue to balance the game, and occasionally releases new maps. Relic and THQ released a stand-alone expansion pack entitled \"Opposing Fronts\" that features the British and Panzer Elites as playable factions. The expansion released simultaneously with a large patch that allowed owners of the original Company of Heroes to play against owners of the expansion \"Opposing Fronts.\" However, players who only own the original game cannot play as the British or Panzer Elite and vice versa for Opposing Fronts.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Company of Heroes departs from the traditional RTS style of gameplay, implementing a more realistic and tactical combat system. It makes several key departures from other RTS games, and many other popular mechanics found in the genre are taken to a greater level of depth and complexity.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Strategic Points<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4127\/367397-smallcohmap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367397\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4127\/367397-smallcohmap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367397\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/4127\/367397-smallcohmap.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>An overhead map showing strategic points and territorial control.<\/figcaption><\/figure>Company of Heroes does not have any \"resource gathering.\" Instead of assigning units to collect resources, there are various points on the map that provide resources in a steady flow. The resources are Munitions, required for special abilities and upgrades; Fuel, which is needed to build vehicles and do basic upgrades; and Manpower, which is a staple resource used for the construction and training of any unit or structure. Each strategic point rewards its owner with one of these three resources. These sectors also serve as population control; the more sectors a player has, the higher their population cap, allowing for more troops to be deployed. A territory must be directly connected to its owner's HQ for the territory give the owner the resource bonus. This allows players to actually \"cut off supply lines\" if an enemy is not effectively guarding their flanks. One or two rogue infantry squadrons can spell disaster for an inattentive player economically by capturing chokepoints behind their front lines. Connected strategic points also give their owner the surrounding territory on which they can build emplacements and equip their troops with special weapons such as Bazookas.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Squads<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603653-amrifle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603653\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603653-amrifle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603653\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10392\/603653-amrifle.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>All six of these Rifleman act as a single unit.<\/figcaption><\/figure>Instead of making individual foot soldiers, players create \"squads\" of units (with the exception of Snipers). Each squad moves as a single unit, but can contain anywhere from two to six soldiers. If members of a squad die, they can be reinforced and replaced for a small manpower cost back at their HQ or an in-the-field halftrack. Squads have a built-in AI that is more nuanced than simply shooting back at opponents. If you give the order to move into an area, the individual soldiers in the group not only move and fire independently, but will also use any nearby cover they can find along the way. Once they arrive at their destination, the troops will spread out and use as much cover as is available in their vicinity.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Company Commander and Other Abilities<\/h3>As the battle rages on and units are built and destroyed, the Allies and the Axis gain Command Points. These points can be spent getting access to special units and powers through one of three doctrines for each side. Each doctrine specializes in a form of combat and grants the player more options for pursuing these means. For example, an American player can choose the Infantry Doctrine to supplement his mainly infantry strategy with units exclusive to that doctrine such as the Ranger Squad (elite bazooka infantry), or abilities that would help an infantry centric strategy like Artillery Support. Each player can gain experience (and subsequently Command Points) by killing units, creating buildings, or upgrading units. See Doctrines below for details.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Vehicle Damage<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614065-cohdamagedengine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614065\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614065-cohdamagedengine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614065\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10392\/614065-cohdamagedengine.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>This Armored Car had its engine damaged by a shot to the back.<\/figcaption><\/figure>Vehicles have a lot more weight in Company of Heroes than in most RTS games. Rather than completing a rock-paper-scissor triangle, vehicles are simply more robust than infantry, capable of wading through small arms fire without significant injury. Tank are even more drastic, as infantry with rifles and flamethrowers cannot damage tanks at all, forcing players to use specialized anti-armor weapons or other tanks to combat them. Vehicles are generally better armored in the front, weaker on the sides, and weakest in the rear, more accurately reflecting real life armor design. A well placed rocket at the rear of a vehicle could possibly take it out in one shot, but it may take several rockets to accomplish the same task at the front or that particular weapon may not even be capable of damaging it from the front, if the target is a tank. In addition to normal damage, special debilitations can occur to powered vehicles if they are hit in certain locations. These effects range from a damaged engine to broken treads to killed gunners. The Rifleman squad's sticky bomb actually revolves around these hindrances as it does little damage to heavy armor but will almost always leave its target with a hampering condition.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Structural Damage<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4127\/367388-hqprogression.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367388\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4127\/367388-hqprogression.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367388\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/4127\/367388-hqprogression.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>An HQ's progression of destruction<\/figcaption><\/figure>Buildings are very effective for keeping infantry alive. They are better than heavy cover against direct and indirect fire and give those garrisoned inside a range bonus thanks to elevation. However, they are not indestructible. If something bigger than a rifle round hits a building it takes damage to the total structure as it would in any RTS but because of the smaller scale of Company of Heroes, the buildings can also take regional damage from direct hits. If a tank pounds on one side of a building, only that side of the building will have chunks taken out of it. This can be a twisted terraforming advantage if you want to use infantry to guard from a side from a building that has no windows at the moment. One or two well-placed bombs will suddenly make it a perfect, if ruffled, bunker.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Add-ons<\/h3>Most units in the game can be upgraded individually with new weapons or advancements. Infantry can be given AT weapons like Panzerschrecks, armored cars can add reinforced armor to keep lighter vehicles from puncturing its sides, engineers can be equipped with trench-thwarting flamethrowers, the list goes on. Every on-unit upgrade costs Munitions and this is the primary use of Munitions in the game. These add-ons all also possess special preservative qualities depending on their nature. Upgrades to vehicles can be destroyed just like their engines can be damaged. A machine gunner can be killed, or armor plates eliminated, forcing players to reinvest resources to get the perk again. If an infantry equips a special weapon and then dies, he leaves the weapon behind on the battlefield, allowing his friends (or foes) to pick it back up and put it into service again.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Cover<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614067-cohtakewhatyoucanget.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614067\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614067-cohtakewhatyoucanget.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614067\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10392\/614067-cohtakewhatyoucanget.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>This Paratrooper is taking whatever cover he can get.<\/figcaption><\/figure>Cover is one of the most basic aspects of Company of Heroes, and a player that uses cover to their advantage will often win a battle. There are three types of cover in the game, heavy, light, and negative. Light cover provides minor benefits, and decreases the damage taken from enemy fire. Units in negative cover, such as streets or low water, actually take slightly more damage than if they had no cover at all (this tends to crop up on choke points such as bridges). In heavy cover, troops take almost no damage from direct enemy fire, while charging enemies get full damage penalties for not being in cover. This makes charging a heavily defended position dangerous and difficult. There are many things to counter the benefits of cover, such as flamethrowers, grenades, and flanking. Flanking counters cover because cover is based on direction, meaning the cover has to be between your unit and the enemy unit to realistically block some of the shots. To make sure that you don't get stiffed on the directional cover mechanic, holding down the right mouse button and dragging in a direction tells your troops which way to face so they can protect themselves intelligently.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Accuracy<\/h3>Little to nothing is a guaranteed kill in Company of Heroes for the simple fact that almost nothing guarantees a hit in the first place. Most of the weapons in Company of Heroes do more damage than in similarly scaled games. It does not appear, however, because every weapon can miss and many of them do so frequently. The primary difficulty of attacking units in cover is, in fact, the reduced frequency with which your men will hit their targets. The exact mechanics of COH's accuracy system are questionable, but the errant shots make infantry battles appear much more chaotic than they normally would creating a more engaging and less by-the-numbers experience. It also makes everyone hold their breath during tank battles where, with tank cannon reload times commonly reaching 8 to 10 seconds, a misplaced shot can spell disaster.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Veterancy<\/h3>In Company of Heroes, units can gain veterancy, which is a bonus to the fighting ability of a unit in some way, such as a damage increase or a speed multiplier. Each army earns veterancy in a different way. The Americans gain veterancy by kills from the individual units, so a rifleman squad that has gotten enough kills will receive veterancy. The Wehrmacht gain veterancy through purchased upgrades, and the buff is universally applied to all units once it is bought. While the American forces are much more of a hassle to improve because of this field experience style the veterancy reward is much greater, the Wehrmacht upgrades are segmented into four separate categories and become very fuel-intensive after the first upgrade. This fuel cost reduces their ability to produce tanks and is therefore not always worth the expenditure. However, the Wehrmacht vehicles receive special bonuses when they are upgraded in this fashion, such as side armor and extra gunners, add-ons that American vehicles can also get but must individually purchase.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Suppression<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614743-cohpinned.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614743\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614743-cohpinned.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614743\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/614743-cohpinned.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The machine gun has Pinned this Engineer behind the tractor. He is frozen in place from fear.<\/figcaption><\/figure>Suppression in Company of Heroes goes hand-in-hand with cover. Suppression is a tool that can be used to stop an enemy advance or supplement an attack force. In layman\u2019s terms, suppression is when a machine gun makes a squad of infantry hide for cover. Suppressed squads lose a considerable amount of mobility and they do not fire as frequently. If a squad is suppressed long enough to be pinned, they no longer take orders, and the only way to use them again is if the suppressor is taken out or if they are retreated. A heavy machine gun can suppress as many infantry squads as walk into its field of fire, so properly deployed teams of MG42's or Browning .30 cals will neutralize an attacking infantry force very quickly. Vehicles cannot be suppressed the way infantry can and as such make excellent emplacement breakers.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Retreating<\/h3>Unlike other strategy games where units are thrown away without a second thought, Company of Heroes emphasizes personal attachment to specific squads with veterancy (they level up as you use them more) and retreating (keeping them alive). If a squad has lost many of its members and is on the verge of being lost (or if you just want the troops back at base for some reason), it can be retreated back to the headquarters, where it can be reinforced back to a full squad or potentially thwart an unforeseen invasion force. Retreating is also beneficial to the survival of a squad because, while cannot fire as they run, they move much faster and take less damage on the way back to the headquarters. It is always cheaper to reinforce an old squad than to build a new one, encouraging the philosophy to live to fight another day.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Allies<\/h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><th><h3>Infantry<\/h3><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614056-amengy3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614056\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614056-amengy3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614056\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/614056-amengy3.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Engineers<\/figcaption><\/figure><b>Engineers<\/b><br \/><ul><li>140 Manpower<\/li><li>3 Unit Points<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Basic squad of three equipped with M3 Grease Guns.

They can build a number of items anywhere on the battlefield from barbed wire fences to tank traps to sandbag walls to minefields, they also carry the tools to remove any wire or sandbags blocking your progress. Engineers are also the primary base builders for the Americans, constructing the unit production facilities back at HQ. If you keep them properly shielded on the frontlines, they can vastly improve any terrain deficiency in your strategy. The American Engineer squad can also be upgraded with a demo charge ability, great for early game base sabotage by bridge destruction, or later raids on bunkers and buildings. To supplement them on the front lines you can equip them with either a flamethrower, which can clear out most any unit from any position if you can get them within range, or a mine detector to safeguard your troops and remove the explosives.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603653-amrifle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603653\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603653-amrifle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603653\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/603653-amrifle.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Rifleman Squad<\/figcaption><\/figure><b>Rifleman<\/b><br \/><ul><li>270 Manpower<\/li><li>6 Unit Points<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The backbone of the American forces, the Rifleman Squad is a squad of 6 soldiers equipped with semi-automatic M1 Garand Rifles, effective at most ranges.

Unfortunately, the individuals of Rifleman Squads are not as well trained as the individuals of a Grenadier squad, so precautions must be taken to prevent the Rifleman squad from being pincer struck as they will falter quickly.

A bit of planning is involved for this troop as it takes three crucial seconds for the team to deploy the gun and even then it can only fire within a 135 degree angle of its setup direction, making it easily to flank and destroy if not properly placed.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603652-ammortar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603652\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603652-ammortar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603652\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/603652-ammortar.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Allied Mortar Team<\/figcaption><\/figure><b>Allied Mortar Team<\/b><br \/><ul><li>280 Manpower<\/li><li>3 Unit Points<\/li><\/ul><br \/>The groundbreaker of the US troops.

Combine it with the Raid ability from the Vehicle Doctrine to let it capture points and the jeep can become a very aggravating pet peeve to Axis supply lines.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603648-amhalftrack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603648\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603648-amhalftrack.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603648\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/603648-amhalftrack.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Allied Halftrack<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><b>M3 Halftrack<\/b><\/p><ul><li>220 Manpower<\/li><li>25 Fuel<\/li><li>4 Unit Points<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The Halftrack acts like a mini-forward HQ: units can reinforce from it and units can be transported in it.

For a hefty munitions charge, the Halftrack can replace its infantry transport capabilities to house an extremely powerful Maxson Quad .50 cal AA platform. It can shoot down hostile aircraft flying overhead (currently all axis aircraft is bugged and as such can't actually be shot down) and is one of the fastest infantry sweepers in the game. Unfortunately, the Quad does not do appreciable damage to tanks and even heavier infantry rounds can damage a halftrack, so it cannot be used carelessly.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603644-amarmoredcar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603644\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603644-amarmoredcar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603644\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/603644-amarmoredcar.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Allied Armored Car<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><b>M8 Greyhound<\/b><\/p><ul><li>280 Manpower<\/li><li>30 Fuel<\/li><li>4 Unit Points<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The basic armored car of the Americans.

On the tank itself, the Sherman can be fitted with both a .50 cal turret gunner and a crab mine flail (a line of rapidly spinning chains that take out both mines and infantry in rather gory fashion). Back at base, the Sherman can gain even more potency from smoke canisters that obscure everything around the tank for 15 seconds as well as a boost to the AP 76mm main gun--beware that upgrading the main gun of the Sherman makes it far better against tanks but actually decreases its effectiveness against infantry and buildings.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603647-amcroc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603647\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/603647-amcroc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-603647\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/603647-amcroc.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>M4 \"Crocodile\" Sherman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><b>M4 \"Crocodile\" Sherman<\/b><\/p><ul><li>320 Manpower<\/li><li>110 Fuel<\/li><li>8 Unit Points<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The M4 Sherman with a pretty cool perk - a flamethrower.

If you are concentrating solely on infantry, you will soon be sitting on a giant pile of fuel with no real purpose. The 105mm Howitzer are expensive, but their cost in fuel should line up nicely with your supplies. Engineers can build these bad boys anywhere in allied territory and once they're set up they cannot be moved--only rotated, but in most maps the 105 won't need to move anywhere to hit it's target. With each Howitzer every 60 seconds you can rain fire from the skies on any enemies in range. The 105mm, it should be noted, is not as strong as the Howitzer Shoot company power, but it will end up being far less expensive in the long run particularly in the munitions department.

The initial airborne squad is not worth its price pound for pound against other infantry so they must be used tactically to prevent wasting the investment. This can be done by sending them behind heavy weapons teams who are too distracted attacking your forces elsewhere; all members of the airborne squad are armed with carbines so they can swiftly deal with these kinds of threats. When needed they be equipped with Recoilless Rifles, a less powerful but more accurate version of the Bazooka that is great against light vehicles that traditionally prove to be a pain to hit. Airborne get the Fired Up ability Rangers do with the same effects. Their last, and possibly most important, asset is the Satchel Charge, a large hunk of explosive that can be thrown about the distance of a grenade. Use it to take down almost anything that's stationary or too slow to get out of way.

It has an 8 out of 9 for damage against all unit types and the number do not lie; the Pershing's main cannon is high explosive and armor-piercing making it good against both vehicles and structures. It also sports dual machine gun emplacements to keep infantry away. Far from invincible, the Pershing is still a foe upon which attention must be concentrated to successfully dispatch it, giving the Americans a taste of what it is like to be their enemy.<\/td><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614054-amcalliope.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614054\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614054-amcalliope.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614054\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/614054-amcalliope.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Sherman Calliope<\/figcaption><\/figure><b>T34 Sherman Calliope<\/b><br \/><ul><li>3 Command Points<\/li><li>650 Manpower<\/li><li>10 Unit Points<\/li><li>45 second cooldown<\/li><\/ul><br \/>In the same vein as the \"Crocodile,\" another ingenious jury rigging of the Sherman by car mechanics of the 30's nets the Allies the Calliope, a tank-mounted rocket platform.

After advancing up the tech tree a bit, Volksgrenadiers can have all of their weapons replaced with MP40's, completely reversing their mode of operation. These SMG-wielding Volks can decimate an enemy infantry squad in seconds at close range but is much less effective at range.

This drastically improves its effectiveness against infantry as a good salvo could decimate an entire squad if not sufficiently covered. If more firepower is needed, the SdKfz 234 can get the 75mm Puma Cannon upgrade. This upgrade changes the fire rate back to one per salvo but gives the main gun enough kick to damage tanks and perforate armored vehicles.

If you can guide this bundle into direct contact it will cripple or destroy anything except base structures. Use them infrequently to keep from wasting Munitions as well as increase the chance that an Allied foe is unpleasantly surprised by a spontaneously combusting Sherman.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><th><h3>Variants<\/h3><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/604250-wmhalftrackflame.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604250\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/604250-wmhalftrackflame.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604250\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/604250-wmhalftrackflame.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Axis Halftrack equipped with Flammenwerfer<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/604251-wmhalftrackstuka.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604251\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/604251-wmhalftrackstuka.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604251\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/604251-wmhalftrackstuka.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Axis Halftrack equipped with Walking Stuka rockets<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/604243-wmarmoredcar75mm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604243\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/604243-wmarmoredcar75mm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-604243\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/604243-wmarmoredcar75mm.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Axis Armored Car equipped with 75mm Puma cannon<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Wehrmacht Doctrines<\/h2><h3>Defensive Doctrine<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Base Defense Branch<\/th><th>Artillery Support Branch<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>For the Fatherland!<\/b><br \/><ul><li>1 Command Point<\/li><li>45 Munitions<\/li><li>Active for 30 seconds<\/li><li>30 second cooldown<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Any Nationalist movement that doesn't motivate its own troops is not working very well. The Nazi campaign has no problem on that end, particularly when you get \"For the Fatherland!\" which boosts the Defensive power of all Axis troops in friendly territory, it also immediately unsupresses all of your troops in your territory and makes them harder to suppress again.

Use this power to make sure the Allies aren't getting the jump on you in unprotected sectors. The demand for an always-ready interception force to profitably act upon the intelligence you gain from Advanced Warning is problematic, but it is normally a good idea to have such things anyway, so if being ready to benefit from this means devoting a few more resource ticks to defensive forces rest assured they will not be wasted should you stop a plot against your base in time because you did.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614655-wmfortify.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614655\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614655-wmfortify.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614655\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/614655-wmfortify.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Foil plots against your HQ with Fortify the Perimeter.<\/figcaption><\/figure><b>Fortify the Perimeter<\/b><br \/><ul><li>1 Command Point<\/li><\/ul><br \/>The more easily applicable version of \"For the Fatherland!,\" Fortify the Perimeter is a one-two punch of turtling advantages. First one simply gives all base structures such as Krieg Barracks a machine gun turret; this has the obvious application of nullifying stabs at home by mowing down airborne and lowlier hostiles without the intercession of withdrawn troops. The second power (and the more useful of two) allows bunkers to reinforce your infantry squads along with making them more difficult to demolish. If you had any reservations about building Bunkers before, purge them with this; Bunkers are cheap emplacements that can be upgraded with whatever you need and now they can even recuperate your army without the need of a forward barracks.<\/td><td><b>Registered Artillery<\/b><br \/><ul><li>2 Command Points<\/li><li>125 Munitions<\/li><li>35 second cooldown<\/li><\/ul><br \/>A must-have to get the most out of Advanced Warning, Registered Artillery bring a hail of fire down around a strategic point or building you own.

Even heavier than the mighty Panther, the Tiger sacrifices mobility for armor and a bigger gun. Once it is at the front, you'll stop caring about how slow it is. The Tiger tank is one of the most powerful all around tank, taking out infantry and tanks with equal ease. Flanking with a Tiger is not an easy option with low maneuverability and slow turret traverse, although you won't likely need to as it can goes toe-to-toe with even the mighty Pershing and should win every time in equal head-on combat.. Conversely, being flanked is a common occurrence for the Tiger. It will take much more damage from the back; that is it <i>takes<\/i> damage in the back. This tank is a large part of what made Nazi armor as revered an entity as it was and the Tiger in Company of Heroes will not disappoint on this count.<\/td><td><b>Resource Blitz<\/b><br \/><ul><li>3 Command Points<\/li><li>200 Munitions<\/li><li>3 minute cooldown<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Resource Blitz is one of the tougher gambles you have to make playing Company of Heroes.

This is a good thing, to be sure, but losing soldiers is not on the agenda of a Terror doctrine player most days so it can be tough to get any leverage out of it.

When triggered on top of enemy infantry, a swirl of Nazi posters and violent ranting through a megaphone apparently causes every enemy soldier in the region to flee for their lives back to HQ. Aside from the laugh that ensues every time this happens, Propaganda War can save you from impending doom if used properly. Rangers will turn around instead of putting dents in your tanks, or an HMG team will decide to get up and run away , allowing harm free passage across a just recently guarded bridge. The coolest thing to do is combine this with a bombardment if you can see the enemy's HQ. Make their infantry run away and then, with a little bit of timing, they will arrive back at base just in time to be mercilessly hammered from the sky.<\/td><td><b>Firestorm<\/b><br \/><ul><li>2 Command Points<\/li><li>200 Munitions<\/li><li>30 second cooldown<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Firestorm is the Terror Doctrine parallel of Rocket Barrage. It is very hit-or-miss on the damage with the exception of the burning ground aftermath which slowly kills infantry in the radius. It also has the same high-cost low-recharge time combo of Rocket Barrage though if you are playing the Terror Doctrine, you should have a comfortable resource stockpile anyway making this less of an issue. Firestorm is a noticeable notch weaker than Rocket Barrage but far from useless. To assist in the scorched earth follow-up infantry that are hit by any of the artillery shells become suppressed, keeping their heads down until its too late.

None. American cannons have to hit it in the back just to have a chance of damaging it. Bazookas have no hope. Even a friendly-fired V1 rocket won't take it out in one go. This thing is the real deal and nothing is quite as unstoppably lumbering with the most powerful cannon of all and three machine guns. The King Tiger is the best unit in the game hands down based on unit type advantages (9 out of 9 in all four categories) and could take its sweet time turning American tanks into scrap if it didn't do that in two or three shots anyway. That said, the King Tiger does have a few problems. The most relevant of these is its availability both on the doctrine tree as well as deployment. A Terror player who makes a beeline for this leviathan has to invest 9 points just to get it. A lot of fighting has to take place to get to that point and other strategies must be put in place beforehand or the player will simply be taken down before he reaches the power. This is compounded by the number of King Tigers that can be deployed during a game: 1. Just one. If you lose your King Tiger, its gone forever unless resurrected from the grave and the points officially go to no more use. Thankfully, the only physical weakness in the Tiger is its speed which combined with sticky bombs and potential engine damages often means you'll be repairing this battering ram as much as you are using it.<\/td><td><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614051-wmv1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614051\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/614051-wmv1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614051\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10392\/614051-wmv1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The V1 Rocket will vaporize anything and everything on your screen.<\/figcaption><\/figure><b>V1 Rocket<\/b><br \/><ul><li>4 Command Points<\/li><li>150 Munitions<\/li><li>8 minute cooldown<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Click on enemy army.

After killing Jenny's captors, Kane and company attempt to secure the airstrip for their escape, but the planes are blown up and the group overwhelmed, and Kane is left with two choices: take the two-person helicopter with his wounded daughter and desert even Lynch, or flee to the nearby docks with both and leave the rest of the team behind.<\/p><h2>Fragile Alliance<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11097\/233089-kanelynchdeadmen1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-233089\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11097\/233089-kanelynchdeadmen1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-233089\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11097\/233089-kanelynchdeadmen1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Bank robberies are a common scenario for Fragile Alliance.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Kane &amp; Lynch's multiplayer component is known as Fragile Alliance, a semi-competitive, semi-cooperative game mode. Up to 8 players are tasked with stealing as much money as possible from a bank or other institution and getting to the extraction point, where they wait for a van or chopper. The twist is that at any time, anyone can turn on the rest of the group in an attempt to take all of the money for themselves. Doing so will label the player as a traitor, and the one who takes him down will be rewarded.

On November 28th, 2007, then-Editorial Director <a href=\"\/jeff-gerstmann\/3040-89712\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89712\">Jeff Gerstmann<\/a> was let go from GameSpot due to reasons that could not be disclosed at the time. It was around when Kane &amp; Lynch was near to its launch date and its publisher, Eidos Interactive, was heavily advertising the game on GameSpot. After its release, Gerstmann gave Kane &amp; Lynch a 6.0 rating and criticized its flaw character design and poor dialogue. This created a speculation from fans that Eidos was very unhappy with the review and that CNET (GameSpot's parent company) responded to the pressure by firing Gerstmann.<\/p><p style=\"\">This created an uproar amongst the gaming community with gamers deliberately giving Kane &amp; Lynch a very low score on GameSpot as a sign of protest. After Gerstmann's dismissal, <a href=\"\/vinny-caravella\/3040-93491\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93491\">Vinny Caravella<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ryan-davis\/3040-93335\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93335\">Ryan Davis<\/a>, <a href=\"\/brad-shoemaker\/3040-89869\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89869\">Brad Shoemaker<\/a> and <a href=\"\/alex-navarro\/3040-61949\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-61949\">Alex Navarro<\/a> left the company as well. Together, GiantBomb was created and the rest is history.<\/p><p style=\"\">On March 15, 2012, the day GiantBomb was acquired by CBS Interactive - current owner of GameSpot. The term was that the acquisition can only be made if Gerstmann was allowed to reveal to the public for the first time the cause of the infamous dismissal in 2007, to which CBS agreed.

Combining their experiences in game development at larger companies with a love for physics and adventure games, Ron Carmel and Kyle Gabler formed a critically acclaimed title. True to their inspirations, World of Goo is driven by physics-based gameplay while still exploring themes such as consumerism and the media's portrayal of beauty.<\/p><p style=\"\">World of Goo is an expansion of Tower of Goo, a small prototype made by Kyle Gabler for his Experimental Gameplay Project, a rapid prototyping community. The goal of this game was to build as large of a tower as possible, a goal that would later be adopted by World of Goo's sandbox mode, the World of Goo Corporation.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528076-3976921883-world.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528076\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528076-3976921883-world.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528076\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100771\/2528076-3976921883-world.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Probably not evil at all.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The story centers around the World of Goo Corporation, a satire of big businesses that is exploiting goo balls for profit by turning them into popular products such as cosmetics and beverages. The corporation has set up pipes throughout the goo balls' home world in order to collect them. The goo balls work tirelessly to reach these pipes, as they constantly seek adventure and see the pipes as \"warm and inviting.\" The goo balls sucked into the pipe during each level are collected at the World of Goo Corporation, where they instinctively build a tower to the sky. While the goo balls remain blissfully unaware of most of what is going on during the story, the player guides them through a quest to stop the World of Goo Corporation and finish their journey to the sky. The story is revealed to the player through brief cutscenes along with quips from The Sign Painter, an unseen figure who communicates exclusively through signs scattered throughout the world.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5196\/746099-worldofgoo_2008_10_13_12_57_16_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-746099\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5196\/746099-worldofgoo_2008_10_13_12_57_16_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-746099\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5196\/746099-worldofgoo_2008_10_13_12_57_16_47.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The game's title screen. Pick a world to zoom in and begin playing.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The story begins in The Goo Filled Hills, a pastoral island home to many goo balls. Desiring adventure, they escape the island using large balloons in hopes of finding new lands. The story then shifts to Little Miss World of Goo, a land where beauty reigns. There, a giant statue is encountered. This statue powers the majority of the World of Goo through the raw power of its beauty. This beauty, however, is failing as the statue ages. The player orchestrates the injection of Beauty Goo into the statue, ensuring its continued operation. The rejuvenated power source allows for a mysterious factory to open at the southern region of the world.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/176456-worldofgoo_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176456\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/176456-worldofgoo_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176456\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/26\/176456-worldofgoo_04.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Beauty Generator that powers most of the world.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The next region, titled Cog in the Machine, follows the journey of the goo balls through this newly formed factory where outsourcing work is done for the World of Goo Corporation. Eventually, \"Product Z\" is launched at the factory, converting the 2-dimensional world into 3D. An error message informs the player that he\/she is incompatible with this new world, prompting him\/her to seek technical support in the next level, the Information Super Highway. In this world, the goo balls find themselves inside a largely abandoned and dilapidated internet. They first upgrade the woefully outdated internet to support modern graphics, and then proceed to MOM, a spambot who teaches the player how to destroy the World of Goo Corporation. This is done by \"undeleting\" all of the deleted spam email in the history of the internet and sending it to the World of Goo Corporation. This plan succeeds, blowing up the corporation and returning the world to 2D.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528077-7839602556-MOM.j.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528077\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528077-7839602556-MOM.j.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528077\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100771\/2528077-7839602556-MOM.j.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Remember, MOM loves you.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">At this point, the main objective for the player seems complete, as the corporation played the role of the villain. The goo balls, however, have been ignorant of the entire affair, and continue their tireless quest upward. The player is taken to the epilogue level, titled The End of the World. Here, the goo balls take on increasingly difficult challenges, during which The Sign Painter loses faith in their ability to succeed. In a twist ending, a sign left in the final level reveals that each and every goo ball has been sucked up by the still active pipe network and transported to what was once the World of Goo Corporation. The sign then complains that a layer of smoke from the explosion of the corporation is blocking the view from a telescope at the center of the level. The player helps by attaching flying fish to the telescope in order to raise it above the smoke, allowing The Telescope Operator (the new title taken up by The Sign Painter) to see far, eventually spotting a faraway world seemingly inhabited entirely by goo balls, suggesting that this world may have been what the goo balls were seeking during their quest upward.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5196\/746125-worldofgoo_2008_10_13_13_43_22_89.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-746125\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5196\/746125-worldofgoo_2008_10_13_13_43_22_89.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-746125\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5196\/746125-worldofgoo_2008_10_13_13_43_22_89.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>This lovely lady is a collection of smaller goo balls. She must be broken down before she can be collected.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In World of Goo, the player builds structures using balls of goo in order to travel from the starting position to a pipe that sucks in excess goo balls that have not been used. While completion of the level allows for progression to the next level, goo balls collected in excess of the level requirement move to the World of Goo Corporation, a sandbox level in which players compete to build the highest tower using a maximum of 300 goo balls. Some end-of-chapter levels break this convention, requiring the goo balls to reach a certain location or complete a certain task in order to move the story forward.<\/p><p style=\"\">Goo balls come in many varieties, each with its own properties such as tensile strength and flammability. Although missteps can result in an un-winnable scenario, some levels allow moves to be undone through a limited supply of \"time bugs.\" These bugs will regenerate gradually after being used.<\/p><h2>User Interface<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528062-5597061476-inter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528062\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528062-5597061476-inter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528062\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100771\/2528062-5597061476-inter.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Scrapped early attempts at menus such as this show the sort of artificial UI that the developers hoped to avoid when possible.<\/figcaption><\/figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528116-3088306981-Going.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528116\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/100771\/2528116-3088306981-Going.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2528116\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/100771\/2528116-3088306981-Going.png\"><\/a><figcaption>After experimenting with what they saw as overly complicated tutorials, 2D Boy settled on a single sign in the first level.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The developers showed a general dislike of overly artificial UI. The game's very world map represents this idea. The idea of clicking an island in order to zoom in on it and begin playing replaced conventional menus. The game's pipe system was created in order to give an exit that felt natural and fit with the story. The above-mentioned time bugs existed in place of an \"Undo\" button, turning a basic utility into a part of the game world. The issue of a pre-game tutorial, which troubled developers in early builds, was solved with a concise sign in the first level. More complicated concepts are handled as they come along in later levels, typically explained by The Sign Painter. The few conventional UI components are restricted to corners, small and deemphasized. The developers showed a particular apprehension for artificial time limits, presenting the level Super Fuse Challenge Time as an alternative. The only level featuring a time requirement, Super Fuse Challenge Time involves a slowly burning chain of flammable Fuse Goo attached to the structure that the player is building. If the player does not complete the level quickly, the structure is burned to the ground, forcing the level to be reset.<\/p><h2>Version Specific Features<\/h2><h3>Wii<\/h3><ul><li>Simultaneous 4 player co-op game play.<\/li><\/ul><h3>PC\/Mac\/Linux<\/h3><ul><li>Online leader boards for every level were once hosted by 2D Boy.

The other planned expansion was a profanity pack, in which the nonsense chatter of the goo balls was to be replaced with good-natured profanity.

It has been the only entry in the series to incorporate five band members on stage (Singer, Guitarist, Rhythm-Guitarist, Bassist and drummer) opposed to the standard four (sans rhythm-guitarist) usually implemented since the original. This was done to have all five members of Aerosmith be shown on stage at once. As a result, Neversoft had to program new camera angles and shots to compliment this change. To fill the fifth spot for the opening band, a new fictional NPC band member was created, the female rhythm guitarist. This would be her only\u00a0appearance\u00a0in the entire series thus far.<br \/><br \/>  Musically, this was the first Guitar Hero to include a rap\/hip hop song on the setlist, found in Run-DMC's  <i>King of Rock. <\/i>It\u00a0was also the last game in the series to have a set-list that included covers. One feature that future GH iterations would note is the fact that all songs included on disc are master-tracks. While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith does include a majority of master recordings, four of the non-Aerosmith songs are still covered.<br \/><br \/> As well as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith having the only appearance of female rhythm guitarist, it was also the last console game to feature the non-playable band first introduced in the original. Throughout the Guitar Hero franchise, playable characters were accompanied by a specific NPC singer, bassist, drummer and occasionally key-board player. These characters would stop appearing come the release of  <i>Guitar Hero World Tour<\/i>, although the male singer\/drummer make a cameo\u00a0appearance during the game's opening cinematic.\u00a0\u00a0<br \/>  \u00a0<br \/><h2>Track Listing<\/h2> <h3>Tier 1: \"Getting the Band Together\" (Nipmuc High School)<\/h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>1. \"All the Young Dudes\" by Mott the Hoople (cover) <\/li> <li>2. \"Draw the Line\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>3. \"Dream Police\" by Cheap Trick <\/li> <li>4. \"Make It\" by Aerosmith (Re-recording) <\/li> <li>5. \"Uncle Salty\" by Aerosmith<\/li> <\/ul><h3><br \/><\/h3><h3>Tier 2: \"First Taste of Success\" (Max's Kansas City)<\/h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>6. \"All Day and All of the Night\" by The Kinks (cover) <\/li> <li>7. \"I Hate Myself for Loving You\" by Joan Jett <\/li> <li>8. \"Movin' Out\" by Aerosmith (Re-recording) <\/li> <li>9. \"No Surprize\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>10. \"Sweet Emotion\" by Aerosmith<\/li> <\/ul><h3><br \/><\/h3><h3>Tier 3: \"The Triumphant Return\" (The Orpheum)<\/h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>11. \"Complete Control\" by The Clash <\/li> <li>12. \"Livin' on the Edge\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>13. \"Love in an Elevator\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>14. \"Personality Crisis\" by New York Dolls (cover) <\/li> <li>15. \"Rag Doll\" by Aerosmith<\/li> <\/ul><h3><br \/><\/h3><h3>Tier 4: \"International Superstars\" (Moscow)<\/h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>16. \"Bright Light Fright\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>17. \"King of Rock\" by Run-D.M.C. <\/li> <li>18. \"Nobody's Fault\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>19. \"She Sells Sanctuary\" by The Cult <\/li> <li>20. \"Walk This Way\" by Run-D.M.C. featuring Aerosmith<\/li> <\/ul><h3><br \/><\/h3><h3>Tier 5: \"The Great American Band\" (Half Time Show)<\/h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>21. \"Always on the Run\" by Lenny Kravitz <\/li> <li>22. \"Back in the Saddle\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>23. \"Beyond Beautiful\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>24. \"Dream On\" by Aerosmith (Re-recording) <\/li> <li>25. \"Hard to Handle\" by The Black Crowes (cover)<\/li> <\/ul><h3><br \/><\/h3><h3>Tier 6: \"Rock N Roll Legends\" (Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame)<\/h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>26. \"Cat Scratch Fever\" by Ted Nugent <\/li> <li>27. \"Mama Kin\" by Aerosmith (Re-recording) <\/li> <li>28. \"Sex Type Thing\" by Stone Temple Pilots <\/li> <li>29. \"Toys In The Attic\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>30. \"Train Kept A Rollin\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>31. \"Guitar Battle vs Joe Perry\" by Joe Perry<\/li> <\/ul><h3><br \/><\/h3><h3>The Vault<\/h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>32. \"Combination\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>33. \"Kings and Queens\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>34. \"Let The Music Do The Talking\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>35. \"Mercy\" by Joe Perry <\/li> <li>36. \"Pandora's Box\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>37. \"Pink\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>38. \"Rats In The Cellar\" by Aerosmith <\/li> <li>39. \"Shakin' My Cage\" by Joe Perry <\/li> <li>40. \"Talk Talkin\" by Joe Perry <\/li> <li>41. \"Walk This Way\" by Aerosmith<\/li> <\/ul><br \/><h2><br \/><\/h2>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/1\/13158\/970626-gb.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/13158\/970626-gb.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/1\/13158\/970626-gb.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/13158\/970626-gb.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/1\/13158\/970626-gb.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/1\/13158\/970626-gb.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/1\/13158\/970626-gb.png"},"name":"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>Crysis: Warhead<\/i> tells the same story <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11757\" href=\"\/crysis\/3030-11757\/\">Crysis<\/a> did, but from a different point of view. <i>Crysis<\/i> was about a squad of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-346\" href=\"\/nanosuit\/3055-346\/\">Nanosuit<\/a>-equipped special forces operators, Raptor Team, sent in to Lingshen Island, to rescue a team of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-396\" href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\">American<\/a> archaeologists who were captured by <a data-ref-id=\"3035-418\" href=\"\/north-korea\/3035-418\/\">North Korean<\/a> soldiers.

Interactive Entertainment, and both companies are attempting to create the game with a feeling that resembles its gritty movie counterpart. Wanted: Weapons of Fate features no multiplayer, giving the team a greater amount of focus on the story of Wesley and Cross's hunt for the French Fraternity fanatics. Their goal was to create an intense single-player experience. The game is comprised of 9 distinct chapters, each taking an average of 30-40 minutes to complete, giving the game a length of approximately 5 hours (though there is an achievement for finishing it in under 2 hours on the hardest difficulty). The game features a number of unlockables to play with as well.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1528009-wanted.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1528009\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1528009-wanted.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1528009\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1528009-wanted.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Take cover!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Wanted is a third person shooter in the vein of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\" href=\"\/gears-of-war\/3030-12231\/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War<\/a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20497\" href=\"\/dark-sector\/3030-20497\/\" slug=\"dark-sector\">Dark Sector<\/a>, as it relies heavily on cover.

The enemy A.I is designed in such a way that it will continually try to flush the player out of cover, and if you don't move, you may find a grenade lodged in your backside. Another bonus to jumping around to multiple cover is that it keeps your adrenaline high. Adrenaline in this game is shown on screen with a meter, and when it fills up, Wesley or Cross will be able to pull off special moves such as Assassin Time, which slows down time and allows you to get optimal head shots, as well as bullet curving and so-called \"Shrapnel Storms\".<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/651670-art_12733_id_5.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-651670\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/651670-art_12733_id_5.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-651670\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3699\/651670-art_12733_id_5.jpeg\"><\/a><figcaption>Say goodbye!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As stated above, there is a huge focus on moving between cover, and thus there are a ton of transition animations, designed for many different ways to traverse the area. If you are sharing cover with someone on the opposite side of you, you may reach over cover and stab the person in the head. The A.I may do the same thing. The best strategy is to keep moving.<\/p><h3>Playable Characters<\/h3><p style=\"\">In the game's regular campaign, the player will take the control of Wesley or Cross, depending on the level. The two play almost exactly the same, with the exception of the weapons they carry. Early on, Wesley carries only a pistol. Cross, however, can carry dual Hellfire Semi-Automatic Pistols, giving him access to the \"Bullet Explosion\"\/\"Shrapnel Storm\" ability. Wesley gains these pistols and abilities later in the game.<\/p><h3>Unlockables<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10024\/844920-7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10024\/844920-7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844920\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10024\/844920-7.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Unlockable suit!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Fans of the movie complained that the costume Wesley wore in the comic never made an appearance.

It should be mentioned, however, that these costumes have no bearing on the actual gameplay; they are merely extra skins.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1528740-wanted5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1528740\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1528740-wanted5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1528740\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1528740-wanted5.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>One of the few close combat kills.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">More gameplay modes can also be unlocked through entering special codes in the game's codes screen.

However, Alice cannot find refuge as Wonderland seems to be <a href=\"\/corruption\/3015-2899\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2899\">corrupted<\/a> once more, by an unknown force.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the episode at the doctor's, Alice meets her old <a href=\"\/nurse\/3015-2858\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2858\">nurse<\/a>, the malevolent Nurse Pris Witless, who's been blackmailing her ever since Alice had an episode where she started shouting that she started the fire that killed her parents which Witless overheard. Now Alice must take care of the nurse's pigeons or else. While doing that, Alice asks about her rabbit, which is apparently in the hands of Wilton Radcliffe, the lawyer who looks after Alice's inheritance and greedily seeks to take it from her. Alice wants her Rabbit, but before she can ask any more questions she begins <a href=\"\/hallucination\/3015-3418\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3418\">hallucinating<\/a> visions of the <a href=\"\/jabberwock\/3005-2825\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2825\">Jabberwock<\/a>, and for the first time in years dives back into Wonderland.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although at first Wonderland appears pristine and lovely once more, in truth it has has become exceedingly corrupted. Alice finds this out when meeting a dismembered <a href=\"\/the-mad-hatter\/3005-2823\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2823\">Mad Hatter<\/a>, who has been usurped in his position in command of Wonderland's industry by his former-friends-turned-lab-rats, the Dormouse and the March Hare. After getting his arms and legs back, Hatter reveals that a train is rolling through Wonderland and destroying it, leaking a kind of black ooze called Ruin, which can transform into hideous creatures. Alice doesn't understand why the Train is destroying everything, nor how it can be stopped. She also has visions of the night of the fire and she begins telling herself that maybe she <i>did<\/i> start the fire that killed her parents. The Hatter promises to help Alice uncover the truth, but after reuniting with the corpses of his old Tea partners, he falls further into <a href=\"\/insanity\/3015-1503\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1503\">madness<\/a> and <a href=\"\/drowning\/3015-2135\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2135\">drowns<\/a> in his own tea.

Nanny had seen the fire and Alice hoped to gather clues about what happened that night. However, she walks into Nanny's room while she is being beaten by her former <a href=\"\/pimp\/3015-2667\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2667\">pimp<\/a>, who knocks out Alice and sets the bar on fire. Back in Wonderland, Alice finds herself in an arctic wasteland inhabited by violent fish and sharks made of shipwrecks. After reuniting with the Mock Turtle from the first game, Alice descends beneath the sea of Wonderland on his submersible ship, which crashes near Barrelbottom, an underwater village. The Carpenter, working as an entertainer along with the <a href=\"\/walrus\/3015-2196\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2196\">Walrus<\/a>, promises to help Alice if she finds the performers for his show. After accomplishing this mission, it's revealed that the Walrus and the Carpenter are posing as entertainers in order to gather an unwitting buffet of fresh seafood. As the show commences, the Walrus leaps to the stage and begins gorging himself on the cast while the Carpenter admits he cannot help Alice and that she must go see <a href=\"\/caterpillar\/3005-2818\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2818\">Caterpillar<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Back in London, Alice awakes being taken out of the burning building with Nanny, who tells her that she knows nothing about the fire and that she should see Mr. Radcliffe. Alice does just that; Radcliffe explains that she is loony, that she did <i>not<\/i> burn down her house, her cat Dinah made a lamp fall in the library that was already a fire waiting to happen. He gives Alice back her rabbit and it's revealed that Radcliffe gave up on getting Alice's fortune because he simply got tired of waiting. before Alice can ask anymore questions, she dives back into Wonderland.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This time, Alice returns to the first area in Wonderland she saw, the Vale of Tears, now degraded thanks to the Train's influence into the hellish Vale of Doom. Alice proceeds to go on a quest to find the Caterpillar in an Asian-themed area called the Mysterious East, as he might have the answers she needs about the train. On the way, she finds out that the cat did not start the fire that killed her family since the lamp that stayed on to help her fall asleep had been turned off and the cat, Dinah, was in her room. It was Dinah that showed her the way <i>out<\/i> of the burning house by fleeing out the window, which is why she keeps on seeing Dinah in the real world, taking her back to Wonderland. Upon arriving to see the Caterpillar, he transforms into a butterfly and tells her that he has no such answers but that the <a href=\"\/the-queen-of-hearts\/3005-2820\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2820\">Queen of Hearts<\/a> can give her the answers she needs.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Alice once again dives out of Wonderland and finds herself in <a href=\"\/prison\/3035-420\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-420\">prison<\/a>, mainly because she was disturbing bystanders in the street with her unstable antics. However, as soon as she leaves the prison, she goes back to Wonderland, this time in Heartsland - the Queen's former domain - now decaying and dead. After defeating hundreds of Card Guards and the Red Queen's former bodyguard the Executioner, Alice finds the Queen still alive but greatly diminished. She blames Alice for the train and that things would have been better off if Alice had let her take over (i.e. embrace insanity). The Queen insists that Alice already knows the truth, she just needs to find the right memories, and throws Alice into a twisted memory of her time in Rutledge asylum.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It's suggested that while she was at Rutledge, Alice underwent treppaning (a hole drilled into her head), blood-letting, and being held in severe restraints by <a href=\"\/tweedle-dee\/3005-2835\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2835\">Tweedle Dee<\/a> and <a href=\"\/tweedle-dum\/3005-2836\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2836\">Tweedle Dum<\/a>, but she leaves the memory and enters Wonderland again, this time in a dollhouse themed location. She is given cryptic encouragement by the insane children who previously populated Wonderland's school, and who now live in hiding from an unspecified threat. Eventually, Alice realizes the culprit behind all this, a 'Doll Maker'. During <a href=\"\/flashback\/3015-226\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-226\">flashbacks<\/a> and memories that can be picked up, it's revealed that Alice's sister, Lizzie was being stalked by a man, and that this same man burned down the house by locking Lizzie in her room and throwing the lantern in the <a href=\"\/library\/3035-963\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-963\">library<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It's finally revealed that Dr. Bumby, Alice's psychiatrist, is the one who murdered Alice's family and is responsible for the destruction of Wonderland. Young Alice saw him at the scene of the crime, but she repressed what she'd witnessed. Once she started coming out of her madness, Bumby took her under his wing to try to make her forget, or at least to drive her insane again to lessen her credibility. He made Alice create the Train, which he then guided to destroy Wonderland. It's suggested that Bumby has done this to many children, erasing their minds completely, and runs some kind of child prostitution trafficking business. Alice manages to destroy the Doll Maker, a representation of Bumby's influence in her mind, the source of Ruin and the conductor of the Train.

Alice subsequently pushes Bumby in front of a train, killing him instantly. Alice is free of his corruption and Wonderland is saved, but she has still reverted at least somewhat into insanity, and there is much work to be done repairing the damage the Train inflicted on Wonderland.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>Alice: Madness Returns<\/i> is a <a href=\"\/third-person-perspective\/3015-464\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-464\">third-person<\/a> action-adventure platformer.

In the first area of the game the Cheshire Cat instructs Alice to step into a shower of liquid that is pouring out of a giant \"Drink Me\" bottle. This allows Alice to shrink to just a fraction of her size at any time. In addition to being able to fit through small tunnels, shrinking can dodge enemy attacks and grants Alice \"Shrink Sense\", which reveals otherwise invisible drawings and writing around Wonderland that helps to point Alice in the right direction (as well as find secrets.)<\/li><li><b>Embiggening:<\/b> At one point during the game Alice will encounter an \"Eat Me\" <a href=\"\/cake\/3055-56\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-56\">cake<\/a>. After eating a bit of the cake she becomes gigantic and can cause a large amount of damage.<\/li><li><b>Sliding<\/b>: At various points in each world, Alice has no choice but to slide down winding paths she can fall off of, and spots of Ruin that drain health if touched.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In addition to platforming, combat plays an integral part of <i>Alice: Madness Returns<\/i>.

This butcher knife serves as the best weapon against a single enemy due to its high speed.<\/li><li><b>Pepper Grinder<\/b>: The primary ranged weapon. This machine gun-esque kitchen tool can be used to attack enemies from afar and is used quite frequently out of combat as part of puzzles.<\/li><li><b>Hobby Horse<\/b>: The heavy-hitting yet slow Hobby Horse is a powerful hammer-like melee weapon that can be used to inflict great damage on enemies and destroy terrain blocking Alice's way.<\/li><li><b>Clockwork Bomb<\/b>: The Clockwork Bomb is a small ticking rabbit that acts as a remotely detonated bomb. In combat it is used as a distraction to enemies (they will attack the rabbit instead of Alice) and out of combat it is used in platforming puzzles. In puzzles, the player will often have to set it down on a button and complete a series of platforms before it explodes.<\/li><li><b>Teapot Cannon<\/b>: The final weapon in Alice's arsenal is the Teapot Cannon. It is a heavyweight ranged weapon that blasts enemies with balls of scalding hot tea. It can also be charged up to inflict greater damage and used to destroy large objects blocking Alice's way.<\/li><li><b>Hysteria<\/b>: When Alice is on the brink of insanity (i.e. almost out of health) she can enter Hysteria mode. The screen goes black, white and red and Alice becomes crazed. In this mode Alice <a href=\"\/temporary-invincibility\/3015-266\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">cannot be harmed<\/a>, deals <i>far<\/i> more damage, and her weapons do not run out ammo. The catch is that enemies slain in Hysteria mode do not drop Teeth, which are required to upgrade her weapons.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Collectibles<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Wonderland is filled with <a href=\"\/collectibles\/3015-375\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-375\">objects<\/a> that Alice can collect and use for various purposes.

Alice collects hundreds of these, scattered throughout the world, dropped from slain enemies, or hidden inside various containers. Alice can exchange collected Teeth for <a href=\"\/upgradeable-weapons\/3015-133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-133\">weapon upgrades<\/a>. Each weapon can be upgraded three times. Golden teeth award five teeth instead of the usual one.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/rose\/3055-1126\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1126\"><b>Roses<\/b><\/a>: Roses replenish Alice's <a href=\"\/health\/3015-130\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health bar<\/a>.<\/li><li><b>Memories<\/b>: Memories appear as crystalline objects which pertain to a certain person in Alice's life. For example, houses represent a memory of Alice's family, while memories of Dr. Bumby are represented by his spectacles. After collecting a memory, a dialogue snippet from that person will play. While most memories are hidden off the central path of the game and are rewards for thorough exploration, the most important memories (which come in the form of doors holding back a fire) are unmissable and must be triggered to move the plot forward.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/bottle\/3055-133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-133\"><b>Bottles<\/b><\/a>: Bottles of various colours are hidden around Wonderland. Collecting them unlocks <a href=\"\/concept-art\/3015-3763\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3763\">concept art<\/a> and character profiles.<\/li><li><b>Radula Rooms<\/b>: Snail shells that Alice can enter are hidden around Wonderland. Upon entering them Alice will have to complete a challenge presented by one of the characters of Wonderland, ranging from completing a minigame to answering a riddle to a brutal fight for survival against merciless enemies. When a challenge is successfully completed, Alice will receive a <a href=\"\/heart-piece\/3055-2704\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2704\">jar of paint<\/a> that is used to \"Paint the white rose red.\" Four jars are required to paint one white rose completely red, at which point it will be added to Alice's total health.<\/li><li><b>Pig Snouts<\/b>: Pig snouts can be seen flying or mounted on walls. They make a snorting noise, and shooting them with the pepper grinder will cause them to sneeze and teleport to the pork-loving Duchess, who will reward Alice by revealing a path to secrets or spawn a picnic basket with teeth inside.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Outfits and Abilities<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Alice wears <a href=\"\/alternate-costumes\/3015-583\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-583\">different dresses<\/a> during each level.

Players take on the role of the titular <a href=\"\/shank\/3005-10020\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10020\">Shank<\/a>, a former gang member who is on a bloody path of revenge after his boss orders the rest of the gang to kill Shank's wife . The story &amp; tone borrows heavily from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screened.com\/kill-bill-vol-1\/16-1614\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kill Bill<\/a> and other modern grindhouse cinema.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>Solo<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1621799-shank09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1621799\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1621799-shank09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1621799\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1621799-shank09.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Traditional 2D style boss fight.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The story of Shank centers around Shank and tells his story of vengeance. The game is split up into multiple levels (20 \"chapters\") and the story is told through cut-scenes and during gameplay where the screen splits to show you an in game cutscene (similar to what you'd see in shows like 24). It should be noted that the game does not have any subtitles.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game is set in and starts off with Shank walking into a bar. Once inside he asks the bartender where he can find a wrestler named \"The Butcher\". He takes down a poster of a fight that's going to happen, \"The Butcher\" will be there. Right when he's about to leave, the bartender turns on Shank, telling him that he should have remained dead. Men in the bar attack Shank including one with a shank, which our hero takes and brutally murders the other thugs. It's also during this fight that Shank gets his chainsaw and his dual pistols.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1621606-shank02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1621606\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1621606-shank02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1621606\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1621606-shank02.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>An ene  <\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">While Shank makes his way to the arena where the fight is to be held, it's revealed through a series of flashbacks that he was left for dead by the local mob. The Butcher is part of that mob. What Shank is most pissed off about is that said mob took his girlfriend, Eva. Through the flashbacks, it's shown that it's the Butcher who took Eva, only leaving Shank alive so he can hear her scream. Back in the present, Shank makes it to the match and fights the Butcher. After an epic fight, Shank slices his head off but realizes that he killed the wrong guy (he knows this by the fact that the now dead fighter doesn't have the same tattoo as The Butcher on his arm). He finds out that The Butcher is in the other town and goes there.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1621797-shank07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1621797\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1621797-shank07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1621797\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1621797-shank07.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The butcher.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After a rather bumpy and violent train ride, Shank makes it to The Butcher's hide out, a factory where meat is stored. The Butcher reveals that he did indeed kill Eva and that he enjoyed every second of it. Flashbacks also show that it's the Butcher who beat up Shank so badly and that Shank's bandana is red because of the blood that poured out of his skull during the beatdown. Shank fights Butcher, choking him with the chains that hold raw pieces of meat. Shank ties the evil wrestler up with his own chains and sends him to the grinder.<\/p><p style=\"\">Sweet revenge finally fulfilled, Shank makes his way towards Club Stardust, a strip club. It is revealed that the owner of the club (a woman named Cassandra) was also involved in Eva's killing. Shank meets Cassandra at which point a flashback shows that just when Cassandra was about to kill Eva with her katana, Shank showed up and fought Cassandra, giving her a big, red scar across the right part of her face. In present day, Shank kills Cassandra and escapes the club, fighting off waves and waves of ninja strippers.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1622220-shank18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622220\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1622220-shank18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622220\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1622220-shank18.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>An example of the game's gratuitous violence.  <\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Our hero meets up with an old friend of his. It's explained that Shank used to be part of a mob ruled by mob boss Cesar. Shank was Cesar's protege, his favorite. He'd asked Shank to kill Eva (why he had to do this is never really explained) but instead ordered his top men (The Butcher, Cassandra and a priest named Father Angelo) to get the job done. Shank, who used to consider the mob like his family, now wants them all dead. He follows his so called friend, who knows where the evil priest is, but stumbles into a trap. After fighting off an army of minions, he catches up with his \"friend\", chops his left arm off and tells him to go tell Angelo that he's coming. Shank follows the trail of blood left by the amputated mobster and ends up in a church.<\/p><p style=\"\">Shank fights through God's holy house in hopes to sending Angelo to hell. Once again through a flashback, it's shown that it's Angelo that lit Shank's house on fire, thwarting any plans Shank had in saving Eva. As Shank plows through the church, Angelo gets hold of an RPG and makes the holy word rain down upon Shank in the form of missiles. Shank battles Angelo, separating him from his beloved bazooka. But right when Shank is about to hand out the finishing blow, Angelo fires a rocket that makes the church bell fall on Shank, knocking him out. Our hero wakes up tied to an electric chair, face to face with Cesar who tells him that he's his biggest disappointment. The mob boss leaves and Angelo zaps Shank who then unties himself, ties the priest to the death chair and fries him.<\/p><p style=\"\">Shank runs after Cesar, killing anyone in his path. He finally meets up with him and prepares for the final showdown. As they fight, more about Shank's past is revealed. After having gotten the order, Shank goes home to kill Eva. But upon arriving, Eva reveals that she's carrying his child. Just when Shank gets a change of heart, the mob arrives and the rest is history. Shank explained that Cesar had always taught him the importance of family which is why he couldn't go through with it. Cesar tells him that if he had known this, things could have gone differently but he doesn't try to apologize. As the fight nears its end, Shank gets stabbed and shot multiple times in the chest. Despite all this, he gets up and brutally murders Cesar. After this epic climax, Shank walks towards the sunset, his revenge fulfilled.<\/p><h3>Co-op<\/h3><p style=\"\">The story in Co-op is a prequel to the single player story and tells the story of when Shank and Falcone used to be hit men for Cesar's mob.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game starts with Falcone and Shank hanging out talking about life. Falcone makes fun of Shank for going out with Eva, who's a kindergarten teacher. Falcone states that Cesar isn't to pleased with Shank's relationship, a sign of things to come. Shank and Falcone head to Cassandra's strip club and after watching a sexy performance by Cassandra, bikers kidnap her and attempt to rape her in a back alley. Our two heroes arrive in time and kill one of the bikers, leaving the other one for Cassandra to torture.<\/p><p style=\"\">Falcone and Shank head to a wrestling match, a match that Cesar had rigged. According to Cesar, The Butcher was supposed to lose the fight but the wrestler decides to beat his opponent. Of course, Shank and Falcone must put the Butcher back in his place and beat up the butcher, knocking out one of his teeth.<\/p><p style=\"\">Cesar calls the two hit men and ask them to go save Father Angelo who's been locked up by members of his congregation for being corrupt and evil. After killing a number of guards, they set the evil priest free, who decides to kidnap the young minister responsible for the mutiny and brings him to Cesar. After giving him a life lesson, Angelo takes out his magnum and shoots the priest in the face, much to Shank's disapproval.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the holy drama, Shank decides to take Eva out on a date. But before he even starts the car, Falcone calls him for an important hit: the deputy mayor is in town and that he must be eliminated. By taking him out, the mob will be able to control and have a hand on the SWAT (which explains why the mob is using them as goons in the single player). While Shank is killing dudes, Eva goes looking for him because he's parked the car in a no parking zone.<\/p><p style=\"\">After killing the deputy's bodyguard, Shank and Falcone are two fingers away from taking the deputy out when Eva shows up and gets taken hostage. Suddenly Shank is full of doubt, not being able to pull the trigger. Cesar's personal assistant shows up and kills the deputy mayor and is about to kill Eva since she's deemed as a niusance when Shank dives in front of her and kills Cesar's best man. Realizing that they have to flee, Eva and Shank drive off into the sunset while a voice over from Cesar tells his assassins to go and kill them.<\/p><h2>Solo Mode Levels<\/h2><ul><li>Return Home<\/li><li>A Big Show<\/li><li>Other Side of the Tracks<\/li><li>Ride<\/li><li>Gears and Grenades<\/li><li>Meatpacking Plant<\/li><li>The Butcher<\/li><li>Red Lights<\/li><li>A Good Fight<\/li><li>On the Run<\/li><li>Sweet Love<\/li><li>Venom of the Vipers<\/li><li>World of Warriors<\/li><li>A Bad Confession<\/li><li>Bombs and Bells<\/li><li>Unjust Steward<\/li><li>The Underworld<\/li><li>Leap of Faith<\/li><li>Fertile Ground<\/li><li>The Final Fight<\/li><\/ul><h2>Combat<\/h2><p style=\"\">Shank has 3 main attacks; his dual shanks, his larger blades (choose between chainsaw, machetes, fist chains, or katana), and his guns (choose between dual pistols, shotgun, or uzi). Each weapon is selectable on the fly, and is mapped to a face button, so attacks can be easily strung together. There is also a grapple (grab) ability, a pounce attack, and grenades that can be picked up. One of Shank's most original attacks is his pounce, he can pounce on most enemies at which point he pins his enemy down and can kill them in a variety of ways. He can stab him multiple times with his shanks, first stabbing him before violently bashing him on the ground. You can chain another weapon into Shank's violent stabbing and bashing. For example, he can impale him with his chainsaw or dual machetes. While holding him down, he can fire his fire arm at surrounding enemies to keep them at bay or shoot the one he's holding down in the face.<\/p><p style=\"\">Certain attacks will work better on certain enemies, to encourage experimentation. For example, the pounce attack doesn't work on larger enemies, the enemies catching Shank and throwing him to the ground. There are also dogs that maul Shank and enemies equipped with guns or assault rifles. Some larger enemies have riot shields, grenade launchers, flamethrowers and gatling guns. Shank can pick up some of these heavy weapons but they're unequipped when Shank jumps. Some enemies are quick on their feet, dodging most of Shank's attacks while others ram him.<\/p><p style=\"\">Shank also has elements of platforming, employing wall runs, scaling buildings, and shimmying on pipes and ledges.<\/p><p style=\"\">Shank also features a local only co-op mode, in which the second player plays as Shank's former partner in crime, <a href=\"\/falcone\/3005-16354\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16354\">Falcone<\/a> (who bears an odd resemblance to <a href=\"\/danny-trejo\/3040-63974\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63974\">Danny Trejo<\/a>). The story in the co-op serves as a prelude to the story of the single player campaign in Shank.<\/p><h2>Outfits<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are 10 alternate outfits for players to unlock by fulfilling certain requirements:<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1622226-shank24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622226\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106662\/1622226-shank24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1622226\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106662\/1622226-shank24.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Horror Shank - Jason Voorheese would be proud.<\/figcaption><\/figure><ol><li>Kung Fu Shank (<i>Get 1,000 kills<\/i>)<\/li><li>Wildman Shank (<i>Complete the single player campaign on Hard<\/i>)<\/li><li>Shank the Spartan (<i>Complete the co-op backstory<\/i>)<\/li><li>Red Pajamas Shank (<i>Get a 150 hit combo<\/i>)<\/li><li>White Pajamas Shank (<i>get a 100 hit combo<\/i>)<\/li><li>Horror Shank (<i>Get 100 chainsaw kills<\/i>)<\/li><li>The ANY-S Shank (<i>After completing the single-player campaign, while in-game, input: up up down down left right left right B A<\/i><i>.

Players assume the role of either the unsettling Xenomorphs (\"Aliens\"), the deadly Predators, or the Colonial Marines.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game features interwoven single player campaigns for all three species, allowing players to experience the campaign from different points of view. <i>Aliens vs. Predator<\/i> also includes a three-way multiplayer mode.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>Alien vs. Predator 3's<\/i> story starts on a planet designated BG-386 where a mining colony has discovered an ancient pyramid most likely created by the Predator race who have been alerted of the human's discovery of their pyramid. A group of hunters are dispatched to make sure the pyramid and what lay dormant inside it stay sealed and locked away at all costs. But it may be too late as the Alien species locked inside it for untold years has begun to awaken.<\/p><h3>Marine Campaign<\/h3><p style=\"\">The Marine campaign begins with two squads of Marines in two drop ships above the planet who have been ordered for a combat drop. One ship, dubbed the USS Marlow is destroyed by a Predator drop ship after it comes out of cloaking. Major Van Zandt then directs the surviving ship to land, but the player Marine, named Rookie, is knocked out during the drop. After he wakes up, he meets up with another marine named Corporal Tequila. Tequila instructs the Rookie to get systems back online to locate the remaining marines, including Major Van Zandt. Unfortunately, the Major is found cocooned which forced Rookie to shoot him.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rookie moves further into the hive where he confronts the Alien Queen whom he burns alive and destroys in an explosion through the help of Tequila. Rookie then begins to move through the swamp and is contacted by Tequila who sends a dropship to rescue Rookie. Unfortunately, the dropship crashes after being shot down by an unknown force leaving the Rookie alone. The Rookie is then contacted by the colony's administrator named Katya. Katya gives the Rookie instructions to find other survivors throughout the colony. The Rookie also kills a Predator and rescues Tequila who is now infected with a chestburster. Tequila asks Rookie to shoot her, but Katya tells them that they could operate on Tequila to remove the chestburster. However, Weyland the president of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, finds out about the procedure and cuts the power to prevent it. They are then forced to put Tequila into a stasis pod in order to keep the Alien from hatching.<\/p><p style=\"\">With the dropship and the USS Marlow destroyed, Katya tells Rookie, after revealing that Katya is an android, that Weyland has his own personal dropship as well as a personal datapad with sensitive information on it. They then leave to confront Weyland who was actually an android all along, in order to get the datapad and get themselves off the planet. The three characters are then seen in cryo sleep on-board the dropship and traveling to Weyland's personal ship where Weyland is delighted to learn that the chestburster in Tequila is secure and that the personal datapad remained intact and gave him the sensitive information he wanted, the location of the Xenomorph home world.<\/p><h2>Singleplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">In this game you will face many different enemies and challenges based on what character you choose (Alien, Predator, or Human). To make it simple there is a list below that shows every single type of creature there is<\/p><h3>Aliens<\/h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Facehugger: The small creature that makes it all possible. The facehugger's sole purpose is to impregnate other species with eggs, which produce chestbursters that grow into mature aliens. Facehuggers are encountered on a few occasions, often in dark areas and around large eggs and mature aliens. They're small, agile targets that are difficult to hit. If the player's health is low, facehuggers can kill the player outright.<\/li><li>Warrior: The most common Xenomorph encountered by the player in the Predator and Marine campaigns. Although it possesses no special abilities, it's speed and agility make it a deadly enemy, especially when in groups.<\/li><li>Jungle Alien: Very similar to the Warrior, but brown in color. In addition to having the melee capabilities of the Warrior, the Xenomorphs encountered in the jungle are able to split deadly acidic fluid across great distances.<\/li><li>Praetorian: One of the toughest Xenomorphs the player will encounter, these large females will eventually grow and become new Queens. The Praetorian can easily be identified by the large crest on it's skull, which is similar to that of a mature Queen. They are encountered as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-420\" href=\"\/mini-boss\/3015-420\/\"> mini-bosses<\/a> in the Predator and Marine campaigns.<\/li><li>Predalien: The result of a facehugger impregnating a Predator. Unlike the Warrior, the Predalien lacks the ability to climb walls but makes up for this by possessing incredible strength, endurance and a remarkable jumping distance. The Predalien is easily identified by it's large stature and the dreadlocks that hang from it's skull. This abomination is easily the strongest Xenomorph encountered by the player.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Humans<\/h3><p style=\"\">As a colonial marine known only as \"Rookie,\" the player must rely on guns, flares, and a motion tracker to survive. Although there are few main characters in the story line, Rookie occasionally receives backup from fellow his fellow marines. The key to surviving this rather traditional first-person shooter is your skill with one of six main weapons (each of which has a secondary fire mode):<\/p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>1.<\/b> <b>Pistol<\/b>: Your backup weapon throughout the game, and the only weapon with unlimited ammo; effective for clipping enemies from a distance without wasting bullets, killing facehuggers, and finishing off crippled aliens; holds 18 rounds at a time and fires three-round bursts in secondary mode<\/li><li><b>2. Assault Rifle<\/b>: One of the weaker weapons in the game, though its large clip (99 rounds) and grenade launcher attachment make it useful for taking out jungle and warrior aliens<\/li><li><b>3. Sniper Rifle:<\/b> The most powerful weapon in the game in terms of damager-per-bullet; can take most enemies in one to two shots; scope allows user to see outline of enemies in darkness\/dense jungles<\/li><li><b>4. Smart Gun<\/b>: Very powerful weapon made famous by Vasquez (likely the basis for the character Tequila in this game) in the film <i>Aliens<\/i>; weaknesses include limited ammunition and size (takes up two of three weapon slots); primary mode automatically targets enemies, while secondary mode allows for free fire.<\/li><li><strong>5. Shotgun<\/strong>: Very powerful at close range, secondary fire uses both barrels.<\/li><li><strong>6. Flamethrower<\/strong>: Good against the xenos, if you set the xenos on fire and then shoot them with another weapon they will explode. Secondary fire lets you put down fuel that you can then light on fire.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Predators<\/h3><p style=\"\">One of the most powerful creatures in the game, predators have muscles built to take abuse and even armor to back it up. They have an array of weapons that vary from a battle staff (combi stick) to a plasma cannon, and even a shuriken-like throwing disk. They also use claws and and proximity mines.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">In multiplayer the player can choose among the three factions:<\/p><p style=\"\">Aliens: The stealthiest of the three classes, xenomorphs have the ability to sprint nonstop and climb walls and ceilings. They can also perform instant death stealth kills with their tails by slashing and impaling. The aliens can \"sense\" (see) predators even while they are cloaked, and can detect enemies through walls.<\/p><p style=\"\">Humans: Marines have access to a powerful assault rife as a standard weapon and can find more powerful guns around the map. The assault rifle can easily take down a predator or alien. The marines also have a motion sensor so they can detect moving enemies when they are near. Marines can only perform basic melee attacks but if they time their counter correctly then they knock the enemy back far enough to have a second chance with the rifle.<\/p><p style=\"\">Predators: Predators can wield a variety of weapons such as the shoulder mounted plasma caster, mines, active camouflage, thermal vision and wrist blades. The predators do have to find these weapons around the map and using them depletes their suits' energy, which has to be restored at special stations. Like aliens, predators use their leaping ability to gain a strategic advantage.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are a number of multiplayer modes in AVP:<\/p><p style=\"\">Deathmatch: This is traditional 18 player free for all where a player can pick to be either an alien, a human or a predator.<\/p><p style=\"\">Infestation: This starts with a squad of marines and a single alien. When the alien player kills a marine player the dead becomes an alien. When there is only one marine left he gets a heavy weapons drop to help him try and last the last minute or so.<\/p><p style=\"\">Predator hunt: A short 3 minute game where a group of Marines hunt a single Predator and attempt to rack up the most kills.<\/p><p style=\"\">In addition to the vs. multiplayer mode there is a horde-like mode in which up to four marines attempt to survive against waves of attacking aliens.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><p style=\"\"><b>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:<\/b><\/p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Operating System: Windows XP \/ Vista \/ 7<\/li><li>Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 Ghz \/ AMD Athlon 3000<\/li><li>RAM: 1 GB (XP) \/ 2 GB (Vista \/ 7)<\/li><li>Video Card: DirectX 9.0c 128 MB Graphics Card (NVIDIA 7900 or better \/ ATI Radeon X1800 or better)<\/li><li>Sound Card: DirectX 9.0c Compliant<\/li><li>Controller: Keyboard \/ Mouse \/ XBOX 360 Controller<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><b>RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS:<\/b><\/p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Operating System: Windows XP \/ Vista \/ 7<\/li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400<\/li><li>RAM: 2 GB<\/li><li>Video Card: DirectX 9.0c 512 MB Graphics Card (NVIDIA GeForce 8800 or better \/ ATI Radeon HD 2900 PRO or better)<\/li><\/ul><h2>Xbox 360 Installation<\/h2><p style=\"\">An installation to the Xbox 360 hard drive requires 6.1GB of space.

Despite Starkiller dying at the end of the first game, Vader has continued looking for the perfect apprentice by creating clones of Starkiller.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>The clone has been imprisoned for 13 days.

Vader explains that he must learn to hate what he loved and that this clone, like the others, is of no use to him. Refusing to share the same fate as his brothers, the clone force zaps Vader, makes a giant hole in the building he was in and escapes. After <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2612\" href=\"\/skydiving\/3015-2612\/\">                                   skydiving<\/a> for a bit and killing all the Imperial troops on the planet,\u00a0the clone has the idea to steal Vader's\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3055-675\" href=\"\/tie-fighter\/3055-675\/\">                                  Tie Fighter<\/a>. Vader almost stops him but the clone gets away.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>The clone makes his way to the planet Cato-Neimoidia. Kota is being held by the Baron.

The stadium where he fights is situated in the sky city of Tarko-Se and Kota has been fighting for seven straight days. The clone passes himself as Vader which lets him land with ease on the planet. But when the Baron discovers that Vader, it is not, and that the clone is here for Kota, he flees and sends all kinds of bad guys after him. After slogging through waves after\u00a0waves of troopers and killing a gigantic <a data-ref-id=\"3055-361\" href=\"\/helicopter\/3055-361\/\">                                helicopter<\/a>, the clone finally makes it to the stadium. He reunites with Kota who expresses joy, thinking that\u00a0the clone is in fact Starkiller. The reunion is cut short when the baron unleashes his most powerful creature: the Gorog. This towering beast is so huge, that the only solution for defeating it is to\u00a0\"sink\" the city (make it fall through the\u00a0clouds). Starkiller and\u00a0Kota separate and begin to make the city fall and they reunite in the Baron's lodge. The Baron is about to get the upper hand on Kota when the city begins to fall and the Gorog latches on to the lodge, eating\u00a0the Baron and taking Kota in his fall. The clone skydives to save Kota and finishes off the Gorog. As the two Jedi <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2682\" href=\"\/freefall\/3015-2682\/\">                               freefall<\/a>, Kota orders his ship, the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2475\" href=\"\/rogue-shadow\/3055-2475\/\">                              Rogue Shadow<\/a> and the two are saved.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Kota is rejoiced to\u00a0meet his old friend.

The clone enters and is welcomed by\u00a0other versions of himself, dying. He finds Juno and has a vision of the future. He sees Juno getting shot and captured. The clone rushes back to the ship to announce this to Kota who decides that they should head\u00a0to the\u00a0Outer Rim to meet Juno who is now an officer in the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1006\" href=\"\/rebel-alliance\/3015-1006\/\">                       rebellion<\/a>. At the same time, the game shows Vader hiring <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1669\" href=\"\/boba-fett\/3005-1669\/\">                      Boba Fett<\/a> to capture Juno and bring her back to Kamino. Vader knows that this will lead the clone to him.\u00a0\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0Kota and the clone arrive at a flock of rebel ships. They head to The Salvation, where Juno is stationed. Upon arriving however, the ship becomes under attack by Imperial forces and terror droids. The clone tries to get to Juno but he fails and she is kidnapped by Fett. Kota decides that the Rebel Alliance must strike against the Empire and the clone gives Kota the plans to the Imperial cloning facility on Kamino. Upon arriving into the planet's orbit, the Empire ambush the rebels and the planet's shields make it impossible to land on the planet. The Rebels are about to be forced to retreat when the clone has the ingenious idea to crash the serenity into the cloning plant. The Serenity is evacuated and the clone crashes it into the facility, allowing the rebels to raid it.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>The clone helps Kota and the others attack the cloning facility but he warns Kota that he's here for Juno. Despite Kota not wanting the clone to go on alone, the clone does it anyways. After climbing the facility's spire, the clone begins having increasingly violent visions and is ambushed by Vader (this scene is a major call back to the Empire Strikes Back). Vader fights the clone, telling him he's expendable and that he's going to kill him \"a thousand times\". After a fairly long fight, Vader flees and the clone gives chase. He finds Vader with Juno. Vader tells him to lay down his lightsabers and become his <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1779\" href=\"\/slavery\/3015-1779\/\">                     slave<\/a> if he wants Juno to live. The clone does what he's told; drops his sabers and kneels in front of Vader. Juno grabs one of the lightsabers and attempts to stab Vader who evades and force pushes Juno out the window and onto a platform,  <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1246\/1395406-swtfu2_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1395406\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1246\/1395406-swtfu2_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1395406\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/1246\/1395406-swtfu2_4.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Kamino<\/figcaption><\/figure>apparently killing her. This sends the clone into a furious rage and after yet another battle the clone defeats Vader by cutting off his right hand and zapping him until his voice box starts going haywire. The clone holds Vader at his mercy, Vader who tells him that the clone is but an empty shell and that <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1431\" href=\"\/love\/3015-1431\/\">                    love<\/a> means nothing. Kota arrives and tells the clone that perhaps killing Vader is not a good idea since the clone will never know the truth about his past. Kota wants to take Vader as a prisoner, judge him, then execute him. At this point, the player is given a choice to either kill Vader (    Dark Side) or let him be taken as prisoner (Light Side).\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/><h3>Light Side Ending <\/h3>The clone decides to let Vader be taken prisoner. He rushes to Juno's body and embraces it. Suddenly, it's revealed that Juno is in fact alive and the two share a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6210\" href=\"\/kiss\/3015-6210\/\">                  kiss<\/a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4673\" href=\"\/princess-leia-organa-solo\/3005-4673\/\">                 Princess Leia<\/a> arrives and Vader is boarded onto the Rogue Shadow. The clone visits Vader who answers none of his questions. When he says that he's finally free, Vader replies that he'll never be free as long as Juno is alive. The Rogue Shadow enters light-speed while a concealed a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4247\" href=\"\/slave-i\/3055-4247\/\">                Slave I<\/a> sneakily follows them (another reference to\u00a0Empire Strikes Back).\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/><h3>Dark Side Ending <\/h3>The clone is about to execute Vader when suddenly a lightsaber sticks out of his chest. A hooded <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1407\" href=\"\/sith\/3015-1407\/\">               Sith<\/a> appears from behind the clone, who falls to the ground. The Sith frees Vador and force pushes Kota and the rest of the rebels to their <a data-ref-id=\"3015-725\" href=\"\/death\/3015-725\/\">              deaths<\/a> into the stormy water of Kamino. As the clone lives his final moments, Vader explains to him that he wasn't the most perfect clone after all. The Sith removes his hood and is revealed to be a clone. The good clone dies while the Sith goes to hunt the last of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1006\" href=\"\/rebel-alliance\/3015-1006\/\">             Rebel Alliance<\/a>. He passes in front of Juno's lifeless body, barely giving it a glimpse, making him the perfect clone.<br \/><h2>Gameplay<\/h2>For the first time, Starkiller can dual wield lightsabers, which changes the game's fighting style and combos completely. The game will have more <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3\" href=\"\/projectiles\/3015-3\/\">            ranged attacks<\/a> with the return of the game's trademark over the top force powers.

When she locates the artifact, she is ambushed by some mercenaries, led by a man named Vasco. Vasco, not believing in the curse, takes the Mirror from its pedestal, and releases Xolotl in the process. Xolotl proceeds to summon his demonic minions, and begins his destruction of the world by annihilating Vasco's forces. Fortunately, as Xolotl is released, so is the spirit of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15457\" href=\"\/totec\/3005-15457\/\">Totec<\/a>, the titular Guardian of Light, a centuries-old Aztec tribesman who had been the one to defeat Xolotl in the first place. He tells Lara that Xolotl must be stopped and the Mirror <i>must<\/i> be returned to its pedestal before the light of dawn. Without asking why, Lara teams up with Totec (introducing him to modern explosives as she does), and the two chase after Xolotl, taking out progressively bigger and more dangerous foes along the way.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3068\/1292521-lara_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1292521\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3068\/1292521-lara_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1292521\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3068\/1292521-lara_01.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Lara and Totec working together<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In a first for the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-267\" href=\"\/tomb-raider\/3025-267\/\"><i>Tomb Raider<\/i><\/a> series of games, it is played purely from a fixed <a data-ref-id=\"3015-246\" href=\"\/isometric-viewpoint\/3015-246\/\">isometric viewpoint<\/a>. However in typical <i>Tomb Raider<\/i> style, players will still traverse through ruins, battle enemies &amp; huge bosses, find hidden treasure, and solve puzzles to progress through the levels. The game can be played either solo or cooperatively, and the story &amp; puzzle-solving will change slightly depending on which mode you're in.<\/p><p style=\"\">In solo mode, the player is forced to play as Lara Croft. When playing co-op (which can be done both locally or online), one player controls Lara while the other takes control of Totec. Each character has their own abilities, and characters will have to utilize their abilities to solve a puzzle or traverse the terrain. For example, Lara can fire her grappling hook across a cavern, and the nimble Totec can tight-rope walk across it. Alternatively, Totec can throw his spear into a wall to create a makeshift platform for the lighter Lara to jump on, to reach an area she couldn't reach on her own. Also, if you die, your teammate can quickly revive you if they are near by, or you can simply <a data-ref-id=\"3015-989\" href=\"\/respawn\/3015-989\/\">respawn<\/a> next to your teammate after a short countdown (traversal puzzles, in which the player must figure out how to get both characters across an obstacle, will respawn players on the near side, to prevent them from solving the puzzle through <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1408\" href=\"\/suicide\/3015-1408\/\">suicide<\/a>).<\/p><p style=\"\">When playing solo, you control Lara and are given Totec's spear, which can be used in pretty much the same ways as in co-op (attacking, creating temporary platforms on walls, etc.). The spear permanently occupies one of four weapon slots. Totec himself shows up only in cutscenes, to tell Lara that he will take a different path from hers. Most of the puzzles that required both characters to do something or stand somewhere are either somewhat simplified, or you are provided with a big heavy ball that takes Totec's place when you need to keep a floor panel pressed down.<\/p><p style=\"\">Another unique aspect of this game is the addition of a scoreboard. Players earn points for defeating enemies, discovering treasures, and completing levels quickly. Each level has its own set of challenges, which, upon being completed, give the player new weapons, relics, or health and ammo upgrades. These scores are then posted to the worldwide <a data-ref-id=\"3015-30\" href=\"\/leaderboard\/3015-30\/\">leaderboards<\/a>, where players can see how they stack up against other players.<\/p><p style=\"\">The combat is fairly simple, and controls much like a dual-joystick shooter. You move with the left analog stick, aim with the right, then pull the right trigger to shoot. The weapons range from pistols, to rifles, to <a data-ref-id=\"3055-45\" href=\"\/flamethrower\/3055-45\/\">flamethrowers<\/a>, to <a data-ref-id=\"3055-252\" href=\"\/grenade-launcher\/3055-252\/\">grenade launcher<\/a>s, and vary in their damage, rate of fire, and ammo consumption. Your ammo is represented by a blue bar underneath your health, and each shot, depending on the weapon, takes away a fraction of that bar. Both the ammo and health bars can be replenished in various ways, such as pick ups you find on the ground or off of dead enemies. Lara's pistols and Totec's spear both have infinite ammo, and characters will automatically switch to them should they expend all their ammo with another weapon. Both characters also carry an infinite amount of explosives, which have a clearly visible blast radius, and can be detonated at any time.<\/p><p style=\"\">As you collect your rewards for completing a level's challenges, or exploring its secret tombs, you will come across the game's \"loot\" in the form of artifacts and relics. Artifacts serve to increase one of your attributes, which are Weapon (damage), Defense, Bomb (damage &amp; radius), and Speed. The quality of these artifacts ranges from clay, to stone, to gold. The clay and stone ones will increase a specific attribute, but decrease another, whereas the gold ones will not decrease anything. As you progress further, you will find new types of artifacts that increase two attributes at once. The relics, on the other hand, bestow special abilities when they are active, such as health\/ammo regeneration, greater bomb blast radius, and powering up the damage of each weapon shot. The catch, however, is that relics are only active when you completely fill your relic power meter by scoring points, and it will drain completely once full when you take damage. Later relics will also bestow more abilities at once.<\/p><p style=\"\">Your character's inventory screen consists of four weapon slots, one of which is permanently occupied by either Lara's pistols or Totec's spear (depending on which character you are controlling), two artifact slots, and one relic slot.<\/p><h2>Artifacts<\/h2><p style=\"\">You can use two Artifacts at a time, and they will affect your stats.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><th>Artifact<\/th><th>Positive Effects on<\/th><th>Negative Effects on<\/th><th>Obtainable<br \/>at

The game allows players to import their own music (a variety of formats are supported, including MP3s, WMAs, and tracks bought from iTunes).

This is done by moving the mouse or pressing left or right on the keyboard, though gamepad-support is included.

Certain-colored blocks are worth more points than others (the 'hottest' colours being the most valuable, with red scoring highest, followed by yellow, green, blue, and purple), while creating larger clusters and forming <a data-ref-id=\"3015-18\" href=\"\/combo\/3015-18\/\" slug=\"combo\">combos<\/a> are other ways of increasing your score.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5872\/248654-ss_preview_audiosurf04.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248654\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5872\/248654-ss_preview_audiosurf04.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248654\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5872\/248654-ss_preview_audiosurf04.jpg.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Adding another block to the middle column will cause it to overfill<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Players are not penalized for avoiding blocks. In fact, selectively avoiding them is key in maximizing your score and preventing overfilling your columns. Overfilling induces a penalty where you are frozen out for a short period of time and cannot pick anything up. Another possible obstacle are gray blocks, which clog up your columns and can potentially interfere with clusters. These blocks will break after a length of time. White and black blocks act in a similar way, but should they end up in the bottom of the grid, bonus points will be awarded.<\/p><p style=\"\">Some modes also feature <a href=\"\/\/\/\">power-ups<\/a>, and they can be picked up just like blocks are. When picked up, they are immediately activated.

For example, you get a percentage bonus if your grid is empty at the end of the song (known as a 'clean finish'), if you string together a cluster of a sizeable number of blocks, or if you collect a large percentage of yellow or red blocks. Depending on what score you attained, you could be given a gold, silver, or bronze medal. Scores can be posted onto <a data-ref-id=\"3015-30\" href=\"\/leaderboard\/3015-30\/\" slug=\"leaderboard\">leaderboards<\/a>, providing you have an Audiosurf account. Each differently tagged song has a casual, pro, and elite leaderboard (where your score belongs depends on the difficulty of the mode that was played), while bits of information such as the track length and form are also uploaded, serving as a way of detecting fraudulent scores, which can in turn be reported.<\/p><h2>Game Modes<\/h2><p style=\"\">Audiosurf has many different characters to choose from, each of which belong one of six unique classes.

While it is straightforward to play and get a decent points total since the puzzle element barely features (the primary objective is to simply avoid all the gray blocks), the main weakness of this class is that its scoring potential may not be as high as the others. This more 'relaxed' class has a 30% 'stealth' bonus if no gray block is hit.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Mono Pro<\/b> <b>(Pro)<\/b>: This character has a 'widen' ability that allows it to pick up tiles in all three lanes. It also has the ability to jump over tiles for a few seconds, but costs time to recharge. Highways contain more gray blocks.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Ninja Mono (Elite)<\/b>: The ninja can widen itself as well as break up any gray tiles that are collected. The latter ability recharges after a few seconds. Highways are even busier than the Pro variant, with more gray blocks to avoid.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Pointman<\/h3><ul><li><b>Pointman (Casual)<\/b>: The Pointman character can store a tile and drop it into another column. This can be cleverly utilized to form bigger clusters. Holding down the space key brings up 'hint arrows' that suggest which tiles to pick up.<\/li><li><b>Pointman Pro (Pro)<\/b>: Pointman Pro plays the same as Pointman but with a more traffic-filled highway.

You can either play by yourself and move both or play cooperatively with another person and control one each. Because of the addition of an extra vehicle, the highway consists of four lanes instead of three. One car can only move in the two leftmost lanes, while the other can only move in the two rightmost.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Double Vision Pro (Pro)<\/b>: DV Pro plays the same as Double Vision but takes place on a busier highway.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Double Vision Elite (Elite)<\/b>: DV Elite is the toughest variant of Double Vision with an even more hectic highway than DV Pro.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Eraser<\/h3><ul><li><b>Eraser (Pro)<\/b>: Holding the left-click or right-click mouse buttons enters eraser mode, which will erase all of a particular color if it hits that tile (for example, if you hit a red block, every red tile in your three columns will be erased).<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Eraser Elite (Elite)<\/b>: Eraser Elite is pretty much the same as Eraser, but the highway is filled with more traffic.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Pusher<\/h3><ul><li><b>Pusher (Pro)<\/b>: Holding the left-click mouse button as you hit a tile will push it to the left, while holding the right-click will push it to the right.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Pusher Elite (Elite)<\/b>: Pusher Elite is pretty much the same as Pusher, but the highway is filled with more traffic.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Vegas<\/h3><ul><li><b>Vegas (Pro)<\/b>: This has a 'shuffle' option, which shuffles the tiles in your columns when you move to either shoulder of the track or by holding down the left-click mouse button. It will also randomly generate a power-up, which can be used by right-clicking.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Ironmode<\/h2><p style=\"\">Ironmode is not an actual game mode but an option. It's an extra layer of difficulty for those who want an even greater challenge. It increases the speed, allows no overfill, and contains a lot more tiles.

A prequel, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Clear Sky, was announced by GSC Gameworld in 2007 and released to mixed reviews. The game is a non-linear, <a href=\"\/open-world\/3015-207\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world <\/a>shooter, which falls heavily on the <a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">FPS <\/a>side of the FPS RPG genre. It features large open maps, populated by mutants, friendly and enemy NPC characters. There are also several underground maps such as the X10-X18 series of experimental laboratories.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The year is 2012; 6 years after the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant suffered a mysterious second meltdown, leaving the 25km radius area known as the Exclusion Zone a barren wasteland filled with mutants, strange inexplicable anomalies and artifacts with strange properties. In S.T.A.L.K.E.R, players control a \"stalker\", a scavenger searching the Zone for valuable artifacts.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the game, the player must deal with radiation hazards, areas distorted by the explosion and unexplainable by science known as anomalies, as well as enemy stalkers such as bandits or Army soldiers. The game features the \"A-Life\" AI system, in which NPCs will roam the world and perform their own unscripted activities. The game features a main set of storyline missions, as well as many optional tasks that can be performed for rewards (typically assassination or object retrieval missions). The game features a faction system, where the player has different standings (enemy, neutral, friend) to individual faction members and to the faction as a whole. The player may choose to aid different factions, such as Duty or Freedom, in return for different rewards and possible repercussions or to stay neutral.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9278\/376142-stalker1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376142\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9278\/376142-stalker1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-376142\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9278\/376142-stalker1.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game does not play like a normal RPG, where the player may customize their own attributes, but the game does allow the player to equip a wide variety of artifacts which may change the player's vulnerability to various types of damage as well as change their physical attributes while in use. Character interaction is generally limited to a friend-or-foe relationship system with almost no dialogue for generic NPCs. The game features a bare-bones shadow-based stealth system in addition to normal shooter mechanics. The story is told through rendered <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes <\/a>between major story segments.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game is infamous for its instability and many bugs (such as the \"irradiation\" bug, where a player enters a level changer while under the effects of radiation become constantly irradiated even if outside of a radiation hotspot). The developers released five patches, the latest of which (1.006) was recalled due to further bugs caused. Most of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. mod community develops mods for patch 1.0004 and 1.0005, the most commonly used patches. In the meantime, a community patch known as the <a href=\"http:\/\/metacognix.com\/stlkrsoc\/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zone Reclamation Project <\/a>compiled by Natvac has fixed many of the bugs remaining in the game.<\/p><h2>Development and Alpha Build<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was initially announced in November 2001, and was set to be released in late 2003. The game was previously known as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Oblivion Lost. Vehicles were initially a part of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but were scrapped from the final version of the game. In addition, the \"burer\" and \"chimera\" mutants were removed from the final game, as well as several maps, such as \"darkscape\" and the original Limansk map (the original storyline had the player rescuing Strelok's associate Doc from the grasp of mercenaries in Limansk) - all features which the \"<a href=\"http:\/\/priboi-story.extra.hu\/engine\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lost Alpha<\/a>\" mod will attempt to add back to the game.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23808\/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1094312\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23808\/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1094312\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/23808\/1094312-7wxdfytn2z.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, it was delayed several times. The game was finally released world wide on March 22, 2007. The game offers both single player and multiplayer, though the latter is the weaker of the two. The game has since been released on Steam and developed a large cult fanbase, which continues to add in old removed content and to modify the game.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In March 2009, GSC Gameworld released the Oct. 18 2004 alpha build of the then S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oblivion Lost (NOT to be confused with Kanyahlos's Oblivion Lost mod). It includes features cut from the final game, such a stronger sci-fi element as well as driveable vehicles. The game world was larger, with less barbed wire fences reducing level size. GSC Game World stated that they wouldn't provide technical support or guarantee stability for the alpha build. It is, despite the instability, worth downloading and having a look at for any S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan, just to see how much changed.

The second explosion has contaminated the surrounding areas with radiation, causing hideous mutations in the wildlife.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The radiations has also resulted in mutations among animals, making them a whole lot different and a lot more violent compared to their real world counterparts. There also exists quite a few mutated humans, especially in the underground tunnels, which makes the environment a lot more creepy.<\/p><h2>RPG Elements<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A large part of the game deals with the management of the player character and thus effectiveness in The Zone. The character management is split up into two sections: items and character information. The character inventory within the game is made up of various elements of player management. The grid boxes are meant for items and all other areas are for descriptions and other information. The other side of the RPG coin here is the economy of The Zone and the player's state within the mercantile system.<\/p><h3>Items<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4866\/1023631-stalker_20070526_055517.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023631\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4866\/1023631-stalker_20070526_055517.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023631\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4866\/1023631-stalker_20070526_055517.png\"><\/a><figcaption>In-game inventory. Also, stats not representative.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game is riddled with items of many kinds including food, drink, guns, <a href=\"\/ammo\/3055-533\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammo<\/a>, weapons,<a href=\"\/first-aid-kit\/3055-1285\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1285\">med kits<\/a>, armor, and other kinds of items. Each item has a certain weight and, of course, the inventory can only hold a certain amount of weight. The size of each items also means that there is a limit to the amount of items that can be contained within the inventory. The bulk of the inventory will deal with weaponry. The hyper-realistic aspect of the game's gun play means there's a cornucopia of real-world ammo to use. This coincides with the real-world use of Russian and international fire-arms with slightly modified in-game versions of the real weapons. Each weapon can have multiple firing modes, and attachments like scopes and silencers. Strangely enough, silencers are very rare in the game. The game will allow players to equip armor, a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and artifacts.<\/p><h3>Artifacts<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The \"abilities\" in the game can be enhanced by attaching artifacts to the belt. The artifacts can range from common junk to very rare and each have their own cost vs. reward in their use. Players can fit up to five artifacts. The fact that they are a pricy commodity in The Zone doesn't hurt either, except for the radiation.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>Artifact<\/th><th>Positive Effects<\/th><th>Negative

Clicking on an item will provide players with information regarding its uses, stat bonuses it provides, the cost, weight, and a little background info.<\/p><h3>Economy<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are a small number of merchants within the game; they buy everything and sell what they can get. Their inventory items depend how deep they are in The Zone. Money is important in stocking up on items, ammo, and anything else that is needed.<\/p><h3>PDA<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4866\/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023965\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4866\/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023965\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4866\/1023965-cordon02ry9.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The PDA.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another element to consider is the PDA. It features all primary and secondary objectives, the journal, statistics, and the map of The Zone. It's a major source of narrative as it can display tapes and documents that provide an insight into the world. There is also an aspect of competition amongst STALKER as each notable one is given a rank and compete to become the top dog. Admittedly the statistic feature relating to the STALKER is nebulous and hard to discern what defines which value. It does however give statistics such as mutants killed and time played.<\/p><h2>Quests and Factions<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The story-driven quest will be provided by the merchants and if players have fulfilled all previous engagements, a prompt will appear directing players to a particular merchant. The 100 Rad Bar will be a hotspot of STALKERS and other characters ready to give players a job to do; this will be the primary way of obtaining cash and seeing the game world.<\/p><h3>Factions<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Faction interaction is an integral part of Shadow of Chernobyl. Factions in the game consist of the Loners, Bandits, Military, Freedom, Duty, Ecologists, Mercenaries and the Monolith. Players can choose between aiding different groups, such as Freedom or Duty, while others begin as enemies (in the case of bandits and military). Factions are also mentioned in the game which are not represented in the game, such as Final Day and The Confederacy. Joining a faction will gain the player acceptance, entrance into their home bases and allows players to purchase from their traders and take quests from the faction leaders. It is possible to be hostile to all factions. The protagonist's relationship with individual STALKERs depend on the player's actions; enemy factions may have members who are neutral towards the protagonist (if players were friendly with them before becoming hostile to the faction) and neutral factions can have members who are hostile (notably, some groups of loners may be hostile).<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Loners<\/h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Loners are the general stalker population. They are those who are unaligned with other groups. They may vary from green rookies sitting in the rookie village to hardened veterans with assault rifles and exoskeletons. If players have a bad reputation, the loner population may turn hostile. Bandits are the opposite numbers of loners, groups of stalkers who roam the Zone killing and looting, attempting to steal from the factions and lone stalkers alike. They are hostile and vary from thugs with sawed-off shotguns to hardened well-organized gangs armed with MP5s. Bandits can become neutral if the protagonist is enemies with Duty, Freedom, and Loners and have a terrible reputation.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Military<\/h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Military's goal is to rid the Zone of stalkers. They are always enemies. Military consists of regular soldiers, who are generally used to patrol and occupy their bases. These are unused to the Zone and are normally armed with AK-74Us. More elite Spetsnaz are employed for raids and special operations deep into the Zone. These are armed with better quality AN-94 Abakans. The Military also hires veteran stalkers in return for amnesty; Military stalkers may be encountered by the player in the late game and are dangerous enemies. The Ecologists - the scientists - are interested in the new possibilities in science revealed by the Zone; unfortunately they work in an extremely hostile environment filled with enemies (such as the Mercenary faction who work to steal their valuable research, as well as zombies and other mutants who menace them). They are unskilled fighters and generally need the help of the Military (in the form of helicopters), Duty soldiers (who later defend their lab from zombie attacks) and the protagonist. Mercenaries are mysterious soldiers-for-hire wandering the Zone, fulfilling objectives for foreign hire. They are the most mysterious faction, mostly because their agenda is unknown. They are equipped with advanced NATO equipment. A group of mercenaries have been engaged in attempting to infiltrate Freedom.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Duty<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4866\/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023957\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4866\/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1023957\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4866\/1023957-stalker_duty2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A group of Duty members.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Duty was formed out the remnants of the military forces that first ventured into the Zone, the survivors swearing to destroy The Zone and rid the world of its evil. They are closely allied to the Ecologists (to whom they give artifacts for research) and provide shelter for groups of loners in the Rostok area around the 100 Rads Bar. They are primarily involved in suppressing bandits and mercenaries, as well as exterminating mutants. They are armed with Warsaw Pact weaponry, such as the AN-94 Abakan and the AK-74. Veteran Duty soldiers may be armed with superior AS Val or OTs-14 Grozas, which outmatch Freedom's weaponry. Duty has a militaristic command structure and are led by General Voronin. A group of interest is Skull's deserters, a group of veteran Duty fighters who have ignored the ceasefire and are planning to attack the Freedom base.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Freedom<\/h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Freedom believe that the Zone belongs to everyone and shouldn't be closed by the Government. They have taken over the Army Warehouses north of Rostok and are involved in an uneasy ceasefire with Duty forces. Freedom are slightly antagonistic towards Ecologists - seeing them as representatives of the Ukrainian Government - but are neutral to the bandits, preferring a live-and-let-live policy. Freedom are better armed than Duty, with Bulldog RG-6 grenade launchers and SVD sniper rifles as well as NATO weaponry. Freedom have a looser command structure than Duty, and are led by Lukash and his deputy Max.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Monolith<\/h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Monolith control the Red Forest, Pripyat and the Nuclear Power Plant itself. Amazingly, they haven't been rendered zombified by the power of X10, the Brain Scorcher. The Monolith are the most dangerous human enemies in the game, they are heavily armoured in exoskeletons, are armed with G36 and SVD rifles as well as the experimental Gauss rifles. They worship the Monolith, an artifact allegedly able to grant all wishes in a room in the Nuclear Power Plant. The Monolith are brainwashed fanatics and are the enemies of all the other factions.<\/p><h2>The Zone<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1620942-garbage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1620942\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1620942-garbage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1620942\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62890\/1620942-garbage.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Zone is a 30 km wide area that was formed around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant following the 1986 (real) disaster and perverted by the second (fictitious) Chernobyl disaster in 2006.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The real-life Zone stretches between the borders of <a href=\"\/ukraine\/3035-2881\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2881\">Ukraine <\/a>and <a href=\"\/belarus\/3035-2879\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2879\">Belarus<\/a>, and is kept protected by the Ukrainian authorities.

Following the ficticious 2006 disaster (which is what really matters to the game), animals and the wild life in general have suffered grotesque mutations and deadly anomalies can be found pretty much anywhere.<\/p><h3>List of Locations<\/h3><ul><li><b>Cordon<\/b><\/li><li><b>Garbage<\/b><\/li><li><b>Agroprom<\/b><ul><li>Agroprom Underground<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Dark Valley<\/b><ul><li>Lab X-18<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Rostok<\/b><ul><li>Bar<\/li><li>Wild Territory<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Yantar<\/b><ul><li>Lab X-16<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Army Warehouses<\/b><\/li><li><b>Red Forest<\/b><ul><li>Lab X-10<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><b>Pripyat<\/b><\/li><li><b>Chernobyl Power Plant<\/b><ul><li>Sarcophagus<\/li><li>Monolith Control Center<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><h2>Dangers of The Zone<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Resulting from the fictional second Chernobyl Outpost Disaster, Radiation and altered physics have engulfed The Zone, turning it into a hostile and dangerous place.<\/p><h3>Anomalies<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Anomalies are spots where standard physics have been defied, producing a variety of traps, some more deadly than others. Several varieties exist, from mild electric shocks to near invisible tornado-like whirlwinds and Burning Anomalies. If players maintain a keen eye while playing, they will notice air or light distortions that will give their locations away. Anomalies also produce Artifacts and different Anomalies denote a differing possible Artifact. Anomalies always change location after a Blowout.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">List of Anomalies<b>:<\/b><\/h4><ul><li>Burner<\/li><li>Vortex<\/li><li>Springboard<\/li><li>Whirligig<\/li><li>Fruit Punch<\/li><li>Electro<\/li><li>Burnt Fuzz<\/li><li>Gas<\/li><li>Lift<\/li><li>Time<\/li><li>Sparks<\/li><li>Space Anomaly<\/li><\/ul><h3>Radiation<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chernobyl outskirts have suffered from radiation since the initial disaster took place in 1986. However, these were never as deadly as those produced by the second reactor explosion in 2012. Invisible pockets create invisible dead ends and mazes in unexpected places. Like Anomalies, they can change quickly after a Blowout, so pay attention to the Radiometer and don't sprint through unexplored areas. The lasting effects of Radiation can be devastating and should be eliminated with Anti-Rad medicine.<\/p><h3>Mutants<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a result of increased radiation, both humans and animals have succumbed to un-evolutionary mutation, effectively increasing the aggression of those affected. Rarely is there a nice mutant in the world and unfortunately bullets are the solution. Several mutated creatures are within the game, however removed from the final product. These are available through user modifications, such as Oblivion Lost or AMK.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>Description<\/th><th>Mutant<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Heavily mutated humans, thought to be missing military stalkers, that have been engulfed by the zone.

Complete 2009<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The STALKER Complete 2009 mod was designed by professional graphic artists and has set the standards for making STALKER mods. Its grand success has inspired many similar project, but the Complete 2009 is one of the most talked-about and famous mods out there \u2013 for any game, really. The mod has even been reviewed by magazines such as PCFormat among others.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One of the key designers working on the Complete 2009, Pavel Dolgov (ArtisPavel), and the rest of the Complete crew spent nearly two years designing the mod. They have renewed the game with updated visual qualities<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>(over 900 textures have been redone)<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">as well as modified some of the gameplay to make it more fit for people which otherwise might not have originally been into STALKER. The team working on the mod has made sure not to screw around with the core elements of the game; the overall experience will stay the same, albeit enhanced by beautiful graphics fit for a newer generation. Simply put, the whole presentation of the game has been improved so a wider range of audience might be able to enjoy this game as much as hardcore STALKER fans.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The designers have retouched almost every single little detail, and overall the game feels more polished. According to the designers, this mod is especially ideal for players who already have completed the game but want to do a replay.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>Full list of features and enhancements: <\/i><\/p><h3>Weather<\/h3><ul><li>Natural multi-phase day and night transitions, based on daily observations, photographs, and studies by artists from Dolgov Studios<\/li><li>Vast distant views, creating large open world around the player<\/li><li>New multi-phase moon design authored by Dolgov Studios.<\/li><li>Proper sun travel according to date (01.05.2012) and geographic location (Ukraine).<\/li><li>Enhanced High Dynamic Range lighting and Sun effects (including realistic sunsets and sunrises).<\/li><li>Increased weather cycling.<\/li><li>Different types of storms, fast and slow. # Wet surfaces during rain.<\/li><li>High resolution nighttime constellation map. # Improved water animations.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Graphics<\/h3><ul><li>Parallax Occlusion Mapping - Gives 2D textures the illusion of 3D geometry, most visible on surfaces such as brick walls.<\/li><li>Screen Space Ambient Occlusion - A shading method that approximates the way light radiates in real life, creating soft shadows in corner-type places with a difficult lighting sample.<\/li><li>Depth of Field - An effect that creates a gradual decrease in sharpness determined by the subject distance. For example, a distant landscape will appear blurry when compared to closer objects.<\/li><li>Motion Blur - A streaking effect frequently used to show a sense of speed when the camera quickly moves around.<\/li><li>Particle system - Enhanced rendering of fire, explosions, smoke, muzzle, sparks, falling leaves, anomalies, fog, and more.<\/li><li>Water Shaders - Improved water effects ported from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky.<\/li><li>Fire Dynamic Lighting - Fire now illuminates the surroundings, casting dynamic shadows.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Textures<\/h3><ul><li>Locations - all textures replaced with higher quality photographs with partial use of original files, creating highly detailed outdoor and indoor environments.<\/li><li>Living Creatures - Mutated creatures have soaking wet flesh showing through wounds, creating a disturbingly graphic effect. Also, all humans in Zone have been retouched down to even the finest details (armor, shoes, wrinkles, faces, even their eyeballs).<\/li><li>Vehicles - 20 year old vehicles in the Zone now appear realistically rusted and abandoned.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Bug fixes<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game is know for its rather massive arsenal of bugs. But with the Complete 09, the bugs disappear. The community have gathered an extensive number of bugs which the developers have picked up on and which have been eliminated with the Complete mod.<\/p><h3>A.I.<\/h3><ul><li><strong>New abilities<\/strong> - NPCs can avoid anomalies, remove dead bodies from camp sites, throw grenades, change armor, and even heal other NPCs. Players can also give weapons and armor to NPCs by selling or dropping it near them and giving them privacy to equip them (An NPC\u2019s preferences may prevent them from accepting the items, however).<\/li><li><strong>Early detection<\/strong> - Removed the ability for NPCs to notice the player at unrealistically large distances.<\/li><li><strong>Stealth<\/strong> - Knife and other critical sounds such as falling dead bodies, grass, and footsteps have been properly commented to reduce their sound radius, making the gameplay much more realistic.<\/li><li><strong>Death panic<\/strong> - Reduced the sound distance of death cries (in the original game it caused the entire camp to alert once one member was hit, as it was set to be heard at a great distance).<\/li><\/ul><h3>Sound<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Complete 2009 replaces a massive amount of in-game sounds, including weapons, anomalies, equipment clatter, footsteps, nightlife, bullet fly-by sounds and more with higher quality versions. Also, the mod adds unique ambient sounds for each weather cycle. \u201cRepetitive\u201d NPCs will now only say their lines once (such as the \u201cGet out of here, stalker\u201d line), and hundreds of additional ambient sounds like bar kitchen cooking, nighttime horror sounds, fog sounds, and more have been added to the game, creating a more immersive audio experience.<\/p><h3>Other<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There is a bunch of other changes and enhancements as well -- localization, a new interface, additional music like guitar tracks played by stalkers around in the game as well as features as a sleeping bag, which allows the player to speed up time. It has also been added freeplay, which means when the game is completed with the \"good\" ending, the player can continue to roam the mysteries zone.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1616678\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1616678\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62890\/1616678-stalker_soc_ost.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"\/original-soundtrack\/3015-189\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">original score <\/a>for S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl was composed by MoozE with the exception of the last 3 tracks, done by FireLake.

The Mayan legend holds that their 300-day calendar year included five extra missing days, days in which, according to legend, the portals opened. It is Lara's task to open the portal once again.<\/p><p style=\"\">In Underworld, Lara Croft and the environment she explores look much better due to a new graphics engine, and the gameplay itself has been revamped. Interaction with the environment is of special note. If Lara's knees become muddy from crouching the rain will soon wash it away. Lara also pushes through foliage with her hands and leaves footprints in the ground, she is able to destroy parts of the environment, and the people and animals she kills remain where they died.<\/p><p style=\"\">Other additions to this Tomb Raider installment include a new melee combat system and the ability to pick up objects even if they aren't integral to progress in the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">Underworld was released on 18th November, 2008 by developer Crystal Dynamics and publisher Eidos Interactive, and was made available for PS2, PS3, PC, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS. A demo for Xbox Live Marketplace was released on October 28, 2008 at 1.3 GB along side a PC release of this demo days later. The Xbox 360 version features 6 hours of exclusive content in the form of two single-player DLC missions titled \"Beneath the Ashes\" and \"Lara's Shadow\".<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-783139\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-783139\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Lara Croft as she appears in Underworld<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><i>Tomb Raider: Underworld<\/i> is a different experience than most other <i>Tomb Raider<\/i> games because it is somewhat open-ended, giving you the chance to explore and granting the game a less linear feel. As in most <i>Tomb Raider<\/i> games, <i>Underworld<\/i> has secrets and items to collect, so you are going to have to play the game more than once going through multiple paths to find everything.<\/p><p style=\"\">In terms of action, the shooting has been revamped, so that Lara can shoot at two enemies at one time when using her pistols. It has also been noted that combat has been toned down to emphasize the adventure aspect of the game. There are no \"boss battles\" per se in Tomb Raider: Underworld, only larger enemies and challenges.<\/p><p style=\"\">One of the key developments in gameplay has been the \"giant puzzle\" feature which shows the level itself acting as one continuous puzzle for Lara to solve. Developers have mentioned that a big part of the game is watching the level change around you as you solve the puzzles. Instead of a series of puzzles in succession, levels in Underworld are designed to be a mesh of puzzles fitting into a much larger idea than was at first apparent... which comes out in terms of gameplay as a series of puzzles in succession anyway.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>Tomb Raider: Underworld<\/i> is a direct sequel to the previous Crystal Dynamics games <a href=\"\/lara-croft-tomb-raider-legend\/3030-8554\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8554\"><i>Tomb Raider: Legend<\/i><\/a>. As the game opens, Lara is making her way through a flaming Croft Manor. As Lara pushes her way through explosions and makes her way to safety, she finds her butler, <a href=\"\/winston-smith\/3005-2957\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2957\">Winston<\/a> helping her technical advisor <a href=\"\/zip\/3005-2960\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2960\">Zip<\/a> who is injured. Zip attempts to shoot Lara with Winston trying to hold him back. With that the game returns to one week in the past and we see Lara on her private boat in the Mediterranean sea, searching for the mystical burial place of King Arthur, named Avalon. Lara is looking for Avalon because <a href=\"\/amanda-evert\/3005-2962\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2962\">Amanda Evert<\/a>, one of Lara's many attractive female nemeses, explained that <a href=\"\/amelia-croft\/3005-2961\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2961\">Amelia Croft<\/a>, Lara's mother, had been transported to Avalon after pulling a sword from a stone in Nepal.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon finding a temple of 'Proto-Norse' origin, Lara comes to believe that due to the similarities between the English myth of Avalon and the Norse myth of Niflheim being so strong (in reality, the myths have almost nothing in common), that they are merely different cultures interpretations of the same place. Upon further searching the temple under the sea, she finds a gauntlet, supposedly that which the Norse god Thor worn. However, Lara is knocked out by a team of mercenaries under Amanda's hire and abandoned to die in the temple. Lara however, chases down the mercenaries to their ship and climbs aboard where she finds Amanda speaking with another enemy of Lara's; <a href=\"\/jacqueline-natla\/3005-2954\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2954\">Jacqueline Natla<\/a>, who is held captive. As Lara listens to them talk, she learns that Avalon is in fact the same as Helheim the Norse <a href=\"\/hell\/3035-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-24\">Hell<\/a>, rather than Niflheim, and that no-one will be able to enter Helheim without Mj\u00f6llnir; Thor's Hammer. Due to an explosion caused by Lara fighting a mercenary, the ship begins to sink. As Lara escapes, she sees Amanda fleeing and shoots at her. Amanda throws the gauntlet into the water and Lara dives in after it, losing Amanda, but saving the god's gauntlet.<\/p><p style=\"\">After inexplicably making her way to coastal <a href=\"\/thailand\/3035-30\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-30\">Thailand<\/a>, Lara learns that her late father, Richard Croft had already done extensive studying on the subject of Helheim and had gotten to the second gauntlet years ago, hiding it in a disguised crypt beneath Croft Manor. Finding the gauntlet (as well as a map to Thor's belt) Lara returns to the surface to find her mansion in flames. Lara makes her way through Croft manor only to be shot at by Zip who explains that Lara shot him and stole Amanda's 'Wraith Stone' from a vault. Lara and Winston explain to Zip that it wasn't Lara who shot Zip, asserting that Lara would have no need to burn down her own mansion and as Lara tells Winston and Zip to get out of the building, she herself goes to check the security feed in the computer room. Upon reaching the computer room, Lara catches a glance at her reflection in the glass wall, noting it looks somehow different. Suddenly, Lara understands that she isn't looking at her reflection, but a perfect doppelg\u00e4nger of herself on the other side of the glass. As Lara and the doppelg\u00e4nger fight, <a href=\"\/alister-fletcher\/3005-2963\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2963\">Alister<\/a> makes his way into the room, trying to escape the flames, but is shot by the doppelg\u00e4nger. Lara attempts to shoot her copy, but she escapes too quickly. Carrying Alister out of the burning manor, it is determined that he is dead and Lara stands, more determined than ever to find Mj\u00f6llnir, stating that she needs Thor's hammer to kill a god; Natla.<\/p><p style=\"\">Making her way to Mexico, Lara finds Thor's belt and as she puts it on, Thor's gauntlets power up, giving her the ability to handle Mj\u00f6llnir as soon as she finds it. She makes her way to Jan Mayen Island, finally finding Mj\u00f6llnir, where she also finds a message from Thor's father Odin, explaining a ritual needs to be undertaken in order to open the gates to Helheim.<\/p><p style=\"\">With Thor's belt, hammer and gauntlets Lara makes her way to the sister ship of the vessel she sank earlier, where Amanda is once again holding Natla. Murdering all the guards on the ship with Mj\u00f6llnir, Lara confronts Natla. Soon after, Amanda and the doppelg\u00e4nger appear, but the doppelg\u00e4nger throws Amanda down a shaft. Natla claims to know the ritual that will open Helheim and agrees to help a wary Lara who proclaims that when Natla makes a wrong move, Lara will kill her. With the help of Natla, Lara opens the gateway to Helheim, deep beneath the Arctic Sea. Eventually, Lara finds Amelia, her mother who has been turned into a thrall, a deceased person or creature that continuously reanimates due to a substance called eitir. Lacking any mind, memory or real conciousness to speak of, Amelia approaches Lara, but Lara coldly and mercilessly guns her down, saying that she was not her mother, and that her mother died a long time ago. After Amelia's death, Natla makes the ridiculous claim that everything up to that point had been orchestrated by Natla to allow her access to Avalon, though it had already been stated that this was not Avalon. She also explains that her first attempt failed years ago when Richard Croft, Lara's father, refused to help her, so Natla killed him.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Lara goes to strike Natla with Mj\u00f6llnir, the doppelg\u00e4nger appears and restrains Lara. Natla leaves Lara to the doppelg\u00e4nger, who attempts to kill Lara, but is suddenly disabled by Amanda, who of course wasn't really dead. Amanda realises that the world is in danger and holds off a number of incoming thralls so that Lara can defeat Natla.<\/p><p style=\"\">When Lara reaches Natla, she is operating a titanic device called the Midguard Serpent, which is designed to bring about the Seventh Age, triggering apocalyptic levels of volcanic activity throughout the world. As Lara steadily destroys the device with Mj\u00f6llnir, Natla tries to stop her, but to no avail. With the destruction of the Midgard Serpent imminent, Lara hurls the hammer at Natla which strikes her and sends her hurtling down into a sea of etir.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Lara regroups with Amanda, they find the exit is blocked and that there is no discernible way out. Lara, however finds a sword like Excalibur embedded in a rock, next to a portal identical to the one that transported Amelia to Helheim in the first place and determines that if they were to pull the sword out, they would be returned to Nepal. However, the portal is broken and Lara determines that the only way for them both to escape is for Lara to hold the Portal steady and for Amanda to pull the sword, with the two of them touching hands at the last moment to both be transported.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Lara and Amanda find themselves in Nepal, they state that they are even. As Amanda leaves, Lara says goodbye to her mother, walking away from the portal as the game ends.<\/p><h2>Controversy<\/h2><p style=\"\">Shortly before the release of the game, a representative of the Eidos PR company Barrington Harvey caused outrage when he made several comments referring to review scores of Tomb Raider: Underworld.<\/p><p style=\"\">The news broke when a GameSpot UK employee left a Twitter post explaining that Eidos had asserted that any reviews of the game with a score lower than eight out of ten were not to be posted online or in print until after Monday, November 24th. When a journalist for Videogaming247 called Barrington Harvery, they shockingly received an honest answer: an employee acknowledged the review ban and admitted that Eidos was attempting to manage reviews in order to make the game's Metacritic rating higher and not put people off buying the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the time, OXM UK and Eurogamer had each put up their reviews of the game, both of which stood at 7.0, an act which the representative asserted had caused problems. The Metacritic score stood at 78 and has since dropped to 77.<\/p><p style=\"\">Although the act of managing review scores is not particularly uncommon in the games industry, it is particularly rare for a representative of such a firm to admit to it as the role of managing review scores is seen by all as dishonest. The news spelled bad news for Eidos who had previously been accused of pulling strings to get <a href=\"\/jeff-gerstmann\/3040-89712\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89712\">Jeff Gerstmann<\/a> fired from his job at GameSpot over a 6\/10 review of their game <a href=\"\/kane-lynch-dead-men\/3030-19874\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19874\"><i>Kane and Lynch: Dead Men<\/i><\/a>.<\/p><h2>Release<\/h2><p style=\"\">In the UK, Game stores offered a Limited Edition copy of the game for the same price as the standard edition. Exclusive to this release is a special bonus DVD which includes \"Exclusive Behind the Scenes Documentary,\" \"Previously Unreleased In-Game Music,\" \"Art Gallery,\" \"Video\" and \"Trailers\" all bought together with the standard game disc in a cardboard packaging.<\/p><h3>Critical Reaction<\/h3><p style=\"\">Although Tomb Raider: Underworld has received mostly positive results from critics, it has prompted suffered a few criticisms.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>GameSpot<\/b> offered a 7\/10 review of the game, noting \"<i>Excellent mix of outdoor, underground, and underwater locations<\/i>,\" but pointing out that \"<i>it does little to address previous games' problems<\/i>,\" which the full review specifies as camera problems, bad dialogue, and a lack of refinement to core gameplay.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>IGN<\/b> went on to point out further flaws, such as object detection and combat issues, although still gave the game no lower than a 7.4\/10 for the PS3.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Nintendo Power<\/b> gave the Nintendo Wii version of the game a 7\/10, citing the game's environments as the best in the series, but pointing out easy puzzles as a cause for concern. Combat was also described as \"so obsolete that the developers needn't have bothered.\"<\/p><p style=\"\">The game has however marveled some reviewers who have produced wildly enthusiastic reviews.<\/p><p style=\"\">The United Kingdom phone network, <b>Orange<\/b>, produced a review of the game scoring the game at 9\/10, praising the environments and Lara's reactions to them. The diminished amount of combat was noted as a positive change, claiming the main appeal was in the exploration of the worlds which come to life.<\/p><p style=\"\">Although <b>The Guardian<\/b> newspaper noted that the camera had a tendency to go haywire, they still gave it a 4\/5 review pointing out the graphics and story (going so far to refer to them as \"unimpeachable\") and stating that fans of the series will \"<i>certainly agree that it's the best<\/i> Tomb Raider <i>game yet.<\/i>\"<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Gamesradar<\/b> also went on to give the game a 9\/10 review, mentioning that although Lara's tendency to \"<i>[freak] out and [jump] off in the wrong direction<\/i>\" happens far too often, that exemplary check-pointing and the decision to ditch boss battles pays off.<\/p><p style=\"\">As of December 6th, 2010, the platform-specific rankings for each version of the game on Metacritic are as follows:<\/p><ul><li><b>Xbox 360<\/b>: 76\/100<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Nintendo Wii<\/b>: 70\/100<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Microsoft Windows<\/b>: 80\/100<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Playstation 3<\/b>: 75\/100<\/li><\/ul><h2>Downloadable Content<\/h2><p style=\"\">Eidos released two new chapters of Tomb Raider: Underworld as DLC for the Xbox 360 only due to an arrangement with Microsoft. Eidos did not announce any prices for the new chapters, but offered release dates. The first chapter, titled \"Beneath the Ashes,\" was stated to be released Christmas 2008, but never arrived. The second one, \"Lara's Shadow,\" was released March 10th, 2009.<\/p><h3>Lara's Shadow<\/h3><p style=\"\">Lara\u2019s Shadow allows gamers to experience Lara\u2019s universe from an entirely new perspective: that of her evil doppelg\u00e4nger. With faster movement, shadow powers, and a melee attack that decimates enemies with devastating accuracy and speed, the doppelg\u00e4nger opens up new gameplay mechanics, areas and puzzles that wouldn\u2019t be possible while playing as regular ol' Lara. Lara\u2019s Shadow is available for 800 Microsoft Points.<\/p><p style=\"\">When it was later confirmed by a reporter for MTV Multiplayer that there are no plans to produce the two new chapters for PS3 or PC, a outcry from the fans followed. An Eidos spokesperson gave a defending statement for the move: <i>\"<\/i>Microsoft asked us how we could extend the fantastic Tomb Raider: Underworld gameplay experience for their thriving Xbox Live community and this exclusive content was the result.\"<\/p><p style=\"\">On November 8th a jury and public vote took place on the Festival Arcadia's <i>Virtually Fashionable<\/i> to determine which of a number of new outfits would be made available to download over Xbox Live Marketplace. The two winning designs, produced by Qu\u00e9bec fashion designers are to be made available at a later date.<\/p><p style=\"\">Four additional costumes for Lara are available for free on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The costumes are two classic Lara Croft outfits and two types of form-fitting wetsuits.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum Settings<\/h3><ul><li><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> XP (admin

Raider: Underworld"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Beat Hazard is a game in which content is in some way generated by data outside the game itself. In the case of Beat Hazard this data comes in the form of the player's music. The game comes with a few songs to start with, but can be infinitely expanded upon by the player's own tastes and content.<\/p><p style=\"\">Beat Hazard was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7104\" href=\"\/cold-beam-games\/3010-7104\/\">Cold Beam Games<\/a> and is ranked in the top 20 for the XNA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dreambuildplay.com\/main\/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dream Build Play 2010 Challenge<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Gameplay takes the form of one of two basic modes: a single-song mode in which the player attempts to survive through the duration of the selected single track or survival mode in which the player plays songs in order starting from the selected track until all allotted lives are spent. In single-song mode, the player is given a choice of four difficulty levels.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82187\/1340677-beat_hazard_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340677\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82187\/1340677-beat_hazard_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340677\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/82187\/1340677-beat_hazard_006.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Tons of sound equals tons of visual feedback<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Once the track (or initial track in the case of survival mode) is chosen, the user's ship is dropped into the center of the arena as the song begins to play. Throughout the song, the player will have to dodge and shoot both asteroids and enemy ships which appear based primarily on the intensity of the track. The player will earn <a data-ref-id=\"3015-700\" href=\"\/power-up\/3015-700\/\">powerups<\/a> at random for destroying these impediments. The game includes four different powerups:<\/p><ul><li>Score multiplier increase<\/li><li>Volume: increases in game volume of track and amplifies on screen visual effects.<\/li><li>Power: increases damage dealt by your ships weapons.<\/li><li>Super bomb: spreads out from the ship to hit multiple surrounding enemies.<\/li><\/ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/134640\/1856290-2011_08_06_00010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1856290\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/134640\/1856290-2011_08_06_00010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1856290\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/134640\/1856290-2011_08_06_00010.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Lots of upgrades<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The score multiplier increases by meeting certain goals in addition to obtaining score multiplier powerups. A Dare Devil multiplier increase is obtained when the player goes for a period of time without firing a weapon and ups the multiplier by 5. A Survival multiplier increase is awarded when the player has gone for a time without losing a ship, adding a single multiplier. These rewards can be obtained multiple times up to the multiplier cap. Volume and power pickups fill meters displayed on the screen (on the bottom-left and bottom-right respectively). Once both meters have been maxed, the Beat Hazard weapon is unlocked which is the most powerful version of the game's standard weapon (a giant laser in the middle of your shots).<\/p><p style=\"\">While powerups play an important part of the game, the power of the player's weapons is more directly influenced by the intensity of the music. If the music is calm, shots barely have any effect without regard to the number of powerups attained. This will also influence the frequency of appearance of enemies, the frequency of their firing upon the player, and the timing and frequency of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-229\" href=\"\/bosses\/3015-229\/\">boss<\/a> appearances.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82187\/1340676-beat_hazard_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340676\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/82187\/1340676-beat_hazard_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340676\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/82187\/1340676-beat_hazard_004.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Boss battles are large and frantic<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Boss enemies have access to multiple different weapon types and cycle through each one in succession. Rather than firing on the boss overall, you must first take out each of its guns. Each boss has two of each type of weapon on each of its wings. Once all the weapons are destroyed, the wings are the next targets finally ending with the remainder of the ship. At this point, the boss is helpless to fight back. Once the boss is killed, you will receive a number of powerups as reward for the defeat. In some instances, you may even fight two smaller boss ships at once. On harder difficulty settings, the appearance of two bosses simultaneously, in addition to their increased firing frequency, can lead to scenarios much like those common in so-called <a data-ref-id=\"3015-321\" href=\"\/bullet-hell\/3015-321\/\">bullet hell shooters<\/a>. Shirking typical boss conventions, you may experience multiple instances of bosses over the course of a single song. Fighting a boss in Beat Hazard doesn't necessarily mean you are at the end of a level, but is still a more difficult section to the level. Smaller enemies can continue pouring out during boss fights as well.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the end of each run (lasting the song in normal play or until you die in Survival), the game tallies up your score and ranks you up. You start at a low level and, as you grow, the game will start you out with new bonuses- multipliers floating around at the start, and the Power and Volume bars being more full at the beginning of a song. The final rank in the game is Elite. Though there are several tiers of Elite for you to get through, there is no real bonus to getting there past bragging rights.<\/p><h2>Leveling Up<\/h2><p style=\"\">Beat Hazard uses a persistent leveling system where anything a player does adds to their level, and in the Xbox 360 version, this unlocks higher starting bonuses, harder difficulty levels, and eventually the player will start with \"Beat Hazard\" mode activated from the start.<\/p><p style=\"\">The PC and Mac versions recently received a patch changing this system over to a perk-based system, requiring that perks be unlocked by leveling up and then purchased and\/or upgraded. While a few perks do not have to be manually enabled (such as the Insane and Suicidal difficulty level \"perks\"), all perks that can be toggled occupy a perk slot, and without upgrading the perk slots available (which is only possible with the Ultra DLC installed), only 3 of these can be active at a time.<\/p><h2>Online Interactions<\/h2><p style=\"\">Beat Hazard does not include any true online interaction (which is understandable, since you'd be having different songs), but it does have a robust leaderboard system which can foster some asynchronous arcade-style score battles. There are leaderboards for overall score, survival mode score, and multiple boards for single-song score divided by song length. The leaderboards further separate into whatever rank you are at the moment.<\/p><h2>Warning<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game prominently displays a warning to players upon startup due to the nature of visual effects used in the game. The game extensively uses bright strobing lights and should not be played by anyone who is sensitive to these effects.<\/p><h2>DLC<\/h2><h3>iTunes AAC Support<\/h3><p style=\"\">Due to licensing costs, Beat Hazard does not include AAC (the iTunes default file format) support out-of-the-box. Support for the AAC format is available as downloadable content - the $1.00 charge is aimed at covering the cost of the license.<\/p><h3>Beat Hazard Ultra<\/h3><p style=\"\">Beat Hazard Ultra was released on June 6th 2011. This downloadable content adds online multi-player, new bosses, enemies, additional perks, power ups and game modes. It costs $12.99 new, or $4.99 for those who already own Beat Hazard.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP\/Vista\/Win 7<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 2.0GHz processor<\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 512+MB of RAM<\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive:<\/strong> 40+MB of free hard drive space<\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> 256MB of video memory<\/li><li><strong>Sound:<\/strong> DirectX-compatible sound<\/li><li><strong>DirectX\u00ae:<\/strong> 9 or later<\/li><\/ul><h2>Mac System Requirements<\/h2><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel<\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 512 MB RAM<\/li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:<\/strong> 250mb HD space<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/1370480-dd_beha.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/1370480-dd_beha.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/1370480-dd_beha.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/1370480-dd_beha.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/1370480-dd_beha.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/1370480-dd_beha.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/1370480-dd_beha.jpg"},"name":"Beat Hazard"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Resident Evil 6 is the eighth mainline entry--when including <a href=\"\/resident-evil-code-veronica-x\/3030-8402\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8402\">Code: Veronica<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"\/resident-evil-zero\/3030-10247\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10247\">Zero<\/a>--in the popular <a href=\"\/resident-evil\/3025-397\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-397\">Resident Evil<\/a> series, announced by <a href=\"\/capcom\/3010-367\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom<\/a> on January 19th, 2012 and released at October 2nd, 2012. Set in 2013, four years after <a href=\"\/resident-evil-5\/3030-20569\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\">Resident Evil 5<\/a> (and 10 years since the downfall of <a href=\"\/umbrella-corporation\/3015-204\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-204\">Umbrella<\/a>), Resident Evil 6 brings back the two most prominent leads <a href=\"\/chris-redfield\/3005-413\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-413\">Chris Redfield<\/a> and <a href=\"\/leon-s-kennedy\/3005-649\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-649\">Leon S. Kennedy<\/a> to canonically star together for the first time in Resident Evil history.<\/p><p style=\"\">Shying away from a linear progression like the most recent Resident Evil titles, Resident Evil 6 allows players to select from any of the three available campaign stories--Leon, Chris and the new character <a href=\"\/jake-muller\/3005-23066\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23066\">Jake Muller<\/a>--in whichever order they so choose, somewhat reminiscent of the first two Resident Evil games. Despite this freedom of choice, it was suggested by RE6 director <a href=\"\/eiichiro-sasaki\/3040-40498\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40498\">Eiichiro Sasaki<\/a> that Leon's story be tackled first.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Overview &amp; Controls<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2174419-re6gp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174419\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2174419-re6gp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2174419\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2174419-re6gp.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Each of the three campaigns features its own unique aesthetic for the HUD<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Resident Evil 6 is an action-shooter in the same vein as prior entries, <a href=\"\/resident-evil-4\/3030-1578\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4<\/a> and Resident Evil 5, though it features a \"totally new control scheme\" allowing much more manoeuvrability. This includes the ability to now move and shoot similar to the <a href=\"\/nintendo-3ds\/3045-117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS<\/a> Resident Evil games, <a href=\"\/resident-evil-the-mercenaries-3d\/3030-32811\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32811\">Mercenaries 3D<\/a> and <a href=\"\/resident-evil-revelations\/3030-31737\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31737\">Revelations<\/a>, and a full 360 movement scheme. Characters can now utilise a roll ability to help dodge incoming attacks and also now for the first time are able to quickly dive into prone and fire their weapon. RE6 sees the return of <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover mechanics<\/a> along with the newly introduced ability to sprint. While sprinting, the character will automatically vault over obstacles and jump across ledges without <a href=\"\/parkour\/3015-272\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-272\">any additional player input<\/a>. Because of the added ability to sprint, characters now run automatically by pushing on the analogue stick all the way; pressing it gently will have the character walk instead. The player's camera view has also been expanded, now allowing a full 360 degree perspective rather than being restricted to as far as the character's neck can turn.<\/p><p style=\"\">Additional customization options have been afforded for players within the options menu, allowing players to now freely switch between aiming from the right side or left, to whether or not their weapons will reload automatically, to choosing between the new cross-hair or the classic laser sight for aiming their weapons, to then even choosing from a small selection of colors for said laser sight.<\/p><h3>Melee &amp; Quick Shot<\/h3><p style=\"\">Melee combat has been heavily streamlined and can be utilised at any time--rather than requiring specific context-sensitive button prompts--which will allow the player to string together a few simple combos using the RT\/R2 button. Players may attack with a dive should they be in the middle of a sprint, and breakable boxes no longer require a knife and can instead be automatically destroyed with a regular melee attack. To compensate, characters have a stamina gauge that slowly depletes (but will recharge) after each melee attack; when timed correctly just before an enemy melee attack, the player can do a powerful counter attack. The gauge is used up when players make use of the 'Quick Shot' ability, which allows the player to swiftly fire off a few firearm rounds complete with auto-aim.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><p style=\"\">Along with the overall control scheme, the inventory system has also been given a complete overhaul, now designed as two separate menus for supplies and weapons - both of which the player must scroll through horizontally. The player may now move while perusing their inventory, though they control their inventory navigation with the right analogue stick temporarily removing control of the in-game camera. The player switches between the two menus using the RB\/R1 button by default for the 360 and PS3 respectively. Health items can now be used with just a single button press as well. For a more convenient approach, the alternative is to use the directional buttons (left\/right for weapons, up\/down for supplies) to scroll. Items cannot be combined within this menu, however.<\/p><h3>Herbs &amp; First Aid Sprays<\/h3><p style=\"\">Herbs can once again be combined, but this time must be converted into 'tablets', which will allow players to heal themselves with just the press of a button rather than having to first select it out of their inventory; players can also tab the button consecutively to use multiple tablets at once. <a href=\"\/first-aid-spray\/3055-619\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-619\">First Aid sprays<\/a>, however, still must be equipped to use. There exist no blue nor yellow herbs this time around and only green and red can be found and combined; red herbs still have no effect when used on their own.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>A list of the herb to tablet conversion is as follows:<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Green Herb = One tablet<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Green Herb + Green Herb = Three tablets.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Green Herb + Green Herb + Green Herb = Six tablets.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Green Herb + Red Herb = Six tablets.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Should a player take enough damage, they will enter into a 'dying state. Here, the player can only crawl, but can also pull up their weapon and attempt to defend themselves. Unlike RE5, however, the player will eventually bring themselves back off the ground once enough time has passed without the player getting attacked; the player's partner character can also still revive the player as well to speed up the process. The player is still within the 'dying' state during this stage and must heal themselves, otherwise a single attack will kill them outright.<\/p><h3>Skill Settings<\/h3><p style=\"\">Unlike Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, players cannot buy weapons. Instead players will find all of each respective campaign's weaponry as the story dictates it, and certain weapons are exclusive across specific campaigns and even characters. Weapons cannot be upgraded either, and now players may purchase ''Skills'' and can equip three at a time.

Leon has Helena Harper at his side, Chris is teamed with BSAA marksman Piers Nivans, and Jake Muller is paired with Sherry Birkin. Matchmaking has been introduced to allow a more accessible venue for cooperative play, including drop-in drop-out capability. When played solo, players can now select which of the two main characters to star as, rather than having to complete the campaign first to unlock the secondary character. Like in RE5, the other character is taken control by an AI should it be a solo game. Though this time around there is no inventory management between the two characters, and the AI is invincible with infinite ammo.<\/p><p style=\"\">With each of the three stories primarily happening concurrently, this eventually allows certain characters to coincide with one another introducing the concept of 4-player cooperative play in Resident Evil 6. As long as the player(s) is online, once they reach a point in one of the stories (eg. Leon &amp; Helena) where the cast will meet up with two from another story (eg. Jake and Sherry), the player is given the option to search online for any other player(s) who is currently at the same spot with the other characters. From there, the quadruple can then temporarily play together to fight against a specific story-dictated boss battle. Otherwise the player(s) can opt to fight alongside two temporary friendly AI's instead.<\/p><h3>Quick Time Events<\/h3><p style=\"\">QTEs once again return, though they are now much more prevalent overall than previous games in the series. They are still most commonly encountered should a player be grabbed by an enemy or in the case of bosses to sometimes avoid an attack entirely. Though unlike in Resident Evil 5 for example, some enemies will require the player to complete multi-tiered QTEs in a row, such as wiggling the stick and then having to time a button press afterwards to throw the enemy off.<\/p><p style=\"\">They are also encountered during specific cutscenes, where the player must press the on-screen prompts as they appear otherwise they will die. Sometimes players may also have to rapidly tap a single button as well, usually as a means to further illustrate a scene depicting a struggle for example. Not only do they occur during cutscenes, but even during in-game events as well. This includes a QTE involving the player dodging an incoming train, to one that has players climbing up a long string of rope by alternating between R2\/RT and L2\/LT at a specific pace.<\/p><p style=\"\">If playing cooperatively, cutscene QTEs are divided between players depending on which character is doing the action on-screen. Though there are still some that require both players to press the prompts simultaneously.<\/p><p style=\"\">Via an online patch, a setting was added so as to make cutscene QTEs automated with no fail state. However in-game cutscenes still exist as they are.<\/p><h3>New Game+<\/h3><p style=\"\">Like past Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 6 allows players to go through any of the completed campaigns with all the weapons they've found and as much ammo and healing supplies as how they left it. When playing through the already completed campaign with the alternate character, however, the player will begin with that character's default equipment only and will have to collect the campaign's set of weapons again. Though even when heading again with the same character as they completed the game with, the game will also give players the option to play through again with the character's default equipment should they so desire.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><h3><a href=\"\/leon-s-kennedy\/3005-649\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-649\">Leon S.

Clark.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\">TBC<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h3>Survival\/Combat Knife<\/h3><p style=\"\">Exclusive to only Chris Redfield and Leon S. Kennedy, they're both equipped with a knife from the outset as a reference to their experience across the franchise. Leon's is the Survival Knife whereas Chris is given the Combat, though besides some cosmetic differences they function the exact same. The name difference is implied to signify the style and tone of both character's respective campaign they're both assigned to, with Leon's slower-paced more horror-orientated atmosphere, and Chris' much more action-focussed military aesthetic.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Knives are slow and not exceptionally powerful, though when used with the Quick Draw ability, the character will do a quick few swipes. Executions on downed enemies are also more powerful with the knife equipped.<\/p><h3>Stun Rod<\/h3><p style=\"\">Sherry Birkin's own exclusive melee weapon, the Stun Rod can do minor electrical damage to her foes, and can also be charged up to discharge a significantly more powerful current - one that can even spread across multiple enemies.<\/p><h3>Hand-to-Hand<\/h3><p style=\"\">Jake Muller, while can still do regular melee attacks, also has available his own additional set of melee attacks tied to his 'Hand-to-Hand' weapon. Using the regular attack buttons, Jake can perform a few simple combos, including a flurry of acrobatic attacks should the player continually use the Quick Draw ability. However, using Hand-to-Hand will still deplete the player's stamina gauge.<\/p><h3>Wing Shooter<\/h3><p style=\"\">A semi-automatic pistol and one that is exclusive to Leon S. Kennedy, the Wing Shooter has an alternate firing mode where Leon will equip another and duel wield the two for more damage output, but less accuracy.<\/p><h3>Picador<\/h3><p style=\"\">Helena Harper's own semi-automatic pistol, it is slightly more powerful than the others but has no alternate firing mode. While Helena is the only playable character across the story to have it available, in The Mercenaries mode Carla Radames also has it as apart of her inventory and is shown with it equipped during the flashback in Edonia during Chris Redfield's campaign.<\/p><h3>Nine-Oh-Nine<\/h3><p style=\"\">Standard military sidearm whom both Jake Muller and Chris Redfield have available, the Nine-Oh-Nine is the weakest of all the handguns and has no alternate fire, either.<\/p><h3>Triple Shot<\/h3><p style=\"\">This is Sherry Birkin's exclusive pistol and like the name applies can fire in bursts of three. Though there is also an alternate single-shot mode where it'll fire like a regular pistol instead.<\/p><h3>Shotgun<\/h3><p style=\"\">Standard pump-action shotgun available across both Leon's and Jake's campaigns.<\/p><h3>Hydra<\/h3><p style=\"\">Returning from Resident Evil 5 is the Hydra sawn-off shotgun. However, this time around it is only available for Helena and is made available from the outset. Loaded with up to three shots, the Hydra is able to unload all three of its shells as fast as the player can press the firing button. When used with Quick Draw, Helena may also sometimes do a kind of stunt roll and shoot from that position.<\/p><h3>Assault Shotgun<\/h3><p style=\"\">Similar in power to the regular Shotgun, the Assault Shotgun is semi-auto and can hold more rounds. This variety of shotgun is available across Chris Redfield and Ada Wong's campaigns.<\/p><h3>Ruger SMG<\/h3><p style=\"\">For Ada's hands only, the Ruger SMG is shot from the hip and has a high fire-rate, though little damage output.<\/p><h3>MP-AF<\/h3><p style=\"\">Starting SMG for Piers Nivans, the MP-AF is almost as accurate as an assault rifle and just as powerful. It has two firing modes available: full auto and single-shot.<\/p><h3>Assault Rifle for Special Tactics<\/h3><p style=\"\">Chris Redfield's starting assault rifle and his primary weapon. Accurate, though it's the weakest assault rifle in the game and takes a relatively long time to reload as well.<\/p><h3>Bear Commander<\/h3><p style=\"\">Available across Jake Muller and Ada Wong's campaign, the Bear Commander is the most powerful assault rifle in the game, though to compensate has the worst accuracy.<\/p><h3>Assault Rifle RN<\/h3><p style=\"\">Found exclusively in Leon's campaign, the Assault Rifle RN resides within a middle ground, with its modest power and accuracy. Though what really sets it apart is the added bayonet, which when equipped will allow the player to use it for any melee attacks and finishers.<\/p><h3>Lightning Hawk<\/h3><p style=\"\">Also returning from Resident Evil 5, the Lightning Hawks continues on with its specific blend of power and recoil resistance. This weapon is only found in Leon's campaign.<\/p><h3>Elephant Killer<\/h3><p style=\"\">Resident Evil 6's own revolver-magnum, the Elephant Killer is the most powerful weapon in the game minus the RPG. Its recoil is strong, though its power is so great it can often shoot through up to three enemies at once.<\/p><h3>Sniper Rifle<\/h3><p style=\"\">A standard bolt-action sniper rifle, this weapon is only found in Jake and Ada's campaigns.<\/p><h3>Semi-Auto Rifle<\/h3><p style=\"\">Found in Leon and Chris' campaigns, the Semi-Auto Rifle has a much faster firing rate and quick reload, though it lacks in power to its sniper rifle brethren.<\/p><h3>Anti-Material Rifle<\/h3><p style=\"\">Piers' sniper rifle exclusive only to him, the Anti-Material Rifle is the third most powerful gun in the game behind the Elephant Killer and RPG. Because of its power, it has a hard kickback and requires that every bullet must be loaded between shots.<\/p><h3>Grenade Launcher<\/h3><p style=\"\">Found only in Chris' campaign, and as is custom with the series the Grenade Launcher can equip multiple types of grenades. There are regular grenade rounds, acid rounds, and freeze rounds. The grenade rounds deal heavy explosive damage with plenty of splash damage to go with it; acid will continually do damage over time; and freeze rounds will instantly freeze all common enemies - from that point on the player only needs shoot once, or use a melee attack, to shatter the frozen enemy.<\/p><h3>Crossbow<\/h3><p style=\"\">Another weapon only for Ada, the Crossbow has two different types of arrows: regular and explosive. Regular arrows generally do little damage, but will always kill a regular enemy instantly when shot to the head. Explosive will stick to an enemy and then quickly proceed to tick down. Once it explodes the damage dealt is about on par with the Grenade Launcher.<\/p><h3>RPG<\/h3><p style=\"\">Only found and used in Leon's campaign for the sole purpose of finishing off the mutated Derek C. Simmons, the RPG can only be attained and kept in the player's inventory if they let their cooperative partner shoot Simmons instead. Once it's unlocked, the purchasable Skill to get infinite RPG ammo is also made available.<\/p><h3>Hand Grenade<\/h3><p style=\"\">Found only in Chris and Ada's campaigns, the hand grenade is an exceptionally powerful tool that can disperse and destroy small crowds with ease.<\/p><h3>Incendiary Grenade<\/h3><p style=\"\">Found in Leon and Ada's campaigns, the incendiary doesn't do as much initial damage as hand grenades but still continually burns through enemies after so many seconds. Using an incendiary grenade is also the only way to truly kill a Rasklapanje.<\/p><h3>Flash Grenade<\/h3><p style=\"\">While it deals no damage, flash grenades will briefly stun enemies allowing players to perform context-sensitive melee moves. Unlike the Las Plagas from RE4 and RE5, flash grenades will no longer instantly kill a mutated enemy.<\/p><h3>Remote Bomb<\/h3><p style=\"\">About as powerful as a hand grenade, Remote Bombs have an added perk in the ability for players to choose when it will explode, introducing the possibility to set a trap.<\/p><h2>Enemies<\/h2><h3>Zombies<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2264710-cg_zombie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2264710\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2264710-cg_zombie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2264710\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2264710-cg_zombie.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Resident Evil 6 sees the return of the classic slow, shambling zombies that hounded the heroes of the series up until Resident Evil 4. This particular iteration of the zombie is much more advanced over the usual zombies from the past, however. They're much faster, agile, and can even leap a small distance through the air to attempt to grab the player by surprise.<\/p><p style=\"\">Furthermore, these zombies are occasionally seen to wield melee weapons--which they groggily attempt to attack the player with--and even firearms. Though much like their effectiveness with melee weapons, zombies have poor accuracy and tend to lamely fire aimlessly until they run out of ammo and then throw the gun away. While zombies are still generally sluggish in movement, this iteration of the undead has the capacity to climb ladders.<\/p><p style=\"\">Zombies are primarily encountered across all of Leon S. Kennedy's campaign, though they do still make an occasional appearance during portions of Ada Wong's as well.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/bloodshot\/3015-7848\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7848\">Bloodshot<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2344116-bloodshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344116\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2344116-bloodshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344116\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2344116-bloodshot.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Certain zombies will have a noticeably red skin-pigment, and once damaged will then begin to mutate into a Bloodshot. Sort of resembling the Crimson Head zombies from the Resident Evil remake, Bloodshots are significantly more durable than regular zombies and will often attempt to leap at the player doing a sizeable amount of damage. Their one weak spot is their heart, which sporadically reveals itself beneath the hard-casing that has formed around it. Melee attacks aren't as effective as against regular zombies, however, though continuous firearm fire is still a viable solution for taking down a Bloodshot.<\/p><p style=\"\">Because these are an advanced mutation of zombies, Bloodshots are also only encountered across Leon and Ada's campaigns.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/javo\/3015-7512\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7512\">J'avo<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2264692-cg_javo1__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2264692\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2264692-cg_javo1__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2264692\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2264692-cg_javo1__1_.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">These multi-eyed monsters are the newest version of heavily mutated common enemies, such as the <a href=\"\/ganado\/3015-1078\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1078\">Ganados<\/a> from Resident Evil 4 and the <a href=\"\/majini\/3015-2356\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2356\">Majini<\/a> in Resident Evil 5, that weren't simply mindless zombies but rather mutations that would grow and change.

Those infected have been shown to wear a mask to cover up their mutated eyes.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3> <\/h3><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p style=\"\">Resident Evil 6 had been stirring within the public's mind for a while. Rumors and small tidbits referencing the game's development began circulating during <a href=\"\/e3-2011\/3015-6449\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6449\">E3 2011<\/a>, when a logo for Resident Evil 6 was posted, along with the date to the same year's <a href=\"\/tokyo-game-show\/3015-2306\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2306\">TGS<\/a> show. Nothing Resident Evil-related occurred during the TGS show, however a trailer was released on September 16th, implying that Resident Evil 6 was to be set in Canada. The trailer was soon shot down by Capcom as a fake. The next batch of rumors began pointing towards China, after a voice actress' resume was found to state she would be portraying a ''Chinese zombie'' for Resident Evil 6.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2109982-date.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2109982\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2109982-date.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2109982\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2109982-date.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">In a similar move during Resident Evil 5's marketing, Capcom began a purposely shoddy looking viral campaign called NoHopeLeft.com, which sprinkled random blogs and notes much like for some sort of conspirators website, detailing how the entire world is under siege. Only one day before the d\u00e9but trailer, the site posted a movie of a greatly distressed Chinese woman making a vlog for a loved one, under the guise of a civilian currently in the midst of whatever catastrophe is going on. It cuts out as she is seemingly attacked by something. Soon afterwards, another video is posted just with the date and time of ''01.19.12 14:00 PST''. Without fail, the site then posted a link to the d\u00e9but Resident Evil 6 trailer at 2pm Pacific the next day with the words ''This explains a lot!!!!''.<\/p><p style=\"\">Continuing the viral campaign, on February 21st the <i>nohopeleft<\/i> website was ''seized and put under investigation'', with a logo not seen before within the series at the bottom of the page linking a downloadable audio file titled ''praying audio''. Much like the title implies, it plays a short 14 second clip of a young Chinese woman (possibly the same one from the vlog) praying in her native language.<\/p><p style=\"\">While originally slated for a 11\/20\/12 release, come the Captivate trailer in April, the date was pushed forward to 10\/02\/12. Despite only being announced early 2012, Capcom stated that development for Resident Evil 6 had been going on since 2010. It was also stated to be the ''largest'' Resident Evil game to date, and the Capcomteam working on it was the biggest one they had working on a single game --approximately 600 people. For comparison's sake, roughly around 120 people worked on Resident Evil 5. Capcom said that with Resident Evil 6, they want to combine the series strongest elements of horror and action; executive producer <a href=\"\/hiroyuki-kobayashi\/3040-32924\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32924\">Hiroyuki Kobayashi<\/a> coined the term ''dramatic horror'' to best summarise their ambitions, in an attempt to replicate Mikami's original fame for creating the <a href=\"\/survival-horror\/3015-4801\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">Survival Horror<\/a> moniker. The popular military-shooter series <a href=\"\/call-of-duty\/3025-82\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-82\">Call of Duty<\/a> was recurrently bought up as influential--notably regarding its sales--in how Capcom decided to steer forward the next instalment of the Resident Evil series.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/e3-2012\/3015-7024\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7024\">E3 2012<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">At the Electronic Entertainment Expo's Microsoft Conference, Hiroyuki Kobayashi and Eiichiro Sasaki took to the stage to unveil their first trailer showing off unedited gameplay, focussing on Leon's story, for Resident Evil 6.<\/p><p style=\"\">Only minutes after the Microsoft Conference was over, Capcom uploaded another cinematic trailer surrounding the plot of the game. On the show floor, multiple streams showing off small segments of Leon's, Chris' and Jake's stories were shown as well, along with further explanation for the gameplay debut of 4-player boss battles.<\/p><h3>SDCC 2012<\/h3><p style=\"\">After the overall poor reception of the 360 demo released on July 3rd--most notably regarding the camera and screen-tearing--Capcom quickly saw fit to showcase a more updated edition of Resident Evil 6, including a much more manageable camera with the character model not taking up so much of the screen, and improved technical aspects. Capcom also used this opportunity to introduce more segments for each of the campaigns, as well as upload another edited story trailer.<\/p><h3>Street Date Broken<\/h3><p style=\"\">On August 31st, more than a month before Resident Evil 6's officially scheduled release, a few copies of the full game--PS3 version--were made available for retail sale in the Polish City of Pozna\u0144. Capcom quickly reported that such copies were in fact 'stolen'.<\/p><h2>Unlockables<\/h2><h3>Mercenaries<\/h3><p style=\"\">Returning once more is the popular Mercenaries minigame, which is pretty much an exact replica of the Resident Evil 5 iteration, and is unlocked by completing the Prelude. Starting with 2 minutes, players are to kill as many enemies as possible within the time limit. Where RE6's Mercenaries differ is the addition of an enemy counter, which shows how many enemies out of a set amount of spawns on the map the player has killed. The more enemies the player kills, the more aggressive the enemies get, and will also begin spawning sub-bosses as well.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players can extend their overall time by finding and destroying Time Bonuses throughout the map, and any enemies that are killed via a melee attack will grant the player an additional few seconds. Mercenaries can be played cooperatively for up to 2 players in both local split-screen and online.<\/p><p style=\"\">By default there are only three characters available and one map. More characters are unlocked by attaining a B rank on each map, and two more maps are unlocked by completing both Chris and Jake's campaigns - one per campaign. Alternate costumes are also available, and are unlocked per character by attaining an A rank with the character itself. Much like in RE5, each of the character's alternate costumes will have a different set of weapons and supplies.<\/p><p style=\"\">Like the main campaign, skills are available for players to purchase with in-game points and equip, though only one Skill may be equipped at a time. These Skills are also completely separate from the ones in the main game, and the player's point currency is unique to Mercenaries and doesn't carry over, nor can it be imported, from the main game. Instead players must collect Skills points from defeated enemies in the Mercenaries mode itself.<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Characters:<\/b><\/u><\/p><table><thead><tr><th>Character Portrait<\/th><th>Starting Inventory<\/th><th>Taunt<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2222616-re6_leon_leon_kennedy_28471873_497_1024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2222616\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2222616-re6_leon_leon_kennedy_28471873_497_1024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2222616\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2222616-re6_leon_leon_kennedy_28471873_497_1024.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Leon S.

It sparked a lot of talk on many forums across the internet (most notably 4chan) and was subjected to parody and even drawings to better illustrate the ''hidden image'' within the number 6 logo.<\/p><p style=\"\">While CAPCOM didn't go as far as to acknowledge the fellatio comparison, they were open to admitting and making fun of the similarities the logo shares with a giraffe via a Facebook update.<\/p><h2><a href=\"\/dragons-dogma\/3030-34776\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34776\">Dragon's Dogma<\/a> tie-in<\/h2><p style=\"\">To coincide with CAPCOM's other equally invested IP, Dragon's Dogma, CAPCOM slotted in a code to unlock a demo for Resident Evil 6 for players who buy new copies of Dragon's Dogma. However, there is a large interval regarding the activation dates between the 360 and PS3 versions because of <a href=\"\/microsoft-studios\/3010-340\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft<\/a> paying for temporary exclusivity; the 360 demo is available to download on July 3rd, whereas for the PS3 it's September 5th. A public demo was then released for all on September 18th for the PS3 and 360 Gold Members (Silver members had to wait until September 25th) which contained different sections of gameplay than in the first demo for each of the three campaigns.<\/p><p style=\"\">CAPCOM have stated that their reasoning for separating the demo activation dates was a ''strategic business decision''. Head of the UK branch David Turner also further elaborated by saying that, ''The dream would be that the millions of Call of Duty fans that are enjoying these fast-paced online games are attracted to this Resident Evil'', implying that they're pushing for the 360 because of its larger player base surrounding Call of Duty.<\/p><h3>July 3rd\/September 5th Demo<\/h3><p style=\"\">At under 1GB, the Resident Evil 6 demo included a small excerpt from each of the three campaigns, Leon, Chris, and Jake--which were originally shown on the stage-floor of 2012's E3 expo.<\/p><p style=\"\">Leon's was situated during the beginning, after he is forced to kill the zombified President Adam Benford. Along with Helena, they make their way through the Tall Oaks University, before bumping into a lost father and daughter who are both infected with the C-Virus, and are eventually forced to defend themselves against an onslaught of zombies.<\/p><p style=\"\">Chris Redfield's begins around the time he and Piers Nivans reunite after their mission in Europe 6 months prior. Then, skipping to their mission during China, the two fight across the rooftops of Langshiang against a small band of J'avo resistance. Jake Muller's demo gives players the taste of one of Resident Evil 6's boss battles as he along with Sherry do battle with B.O.W. Ustanak programmed by Neo-Umbrella to hunt down Jake Muller -- not unlike how The Nemesis stalked Jill Valentine during Resident Evil 3.<\/p><p style=\"\">All three of the campaigns can be played solo or online with another player, though not in splitscreen. Should players die they must restart the demo level over - there are no checkpoints.<\/p><h3>September 18th Public Demo<\/h3><p style=\"\">Sized at 847MB and available for all on both PS3 and 360, Resident Evil 6's second demo gave another taste of each of the three main campaigns. Alongside that, the demo featured a better optimised camera and smoother technical properties.<\/p><h2><a href=\"\/left-4-dead-2\/3030-26782\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26782\">Left 4 Dead 2 <\/a>Crossover<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2463796\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2463796-7a3e866f719485007699737c4ced5258.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2463796-7a3e866f719485007699737c4ced5258.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2463796\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2463796-7a3e866f719485007699737c4ced5258.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">In partnership with <a href=\"\/valve-corporation\/3010-1374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve<\/a>, Capcom have included additional exclusive L4D2-themed content for Resident Evil 6's PC version free of charge.

As you attained a higher level\/rank, the more stuff would gradually be granted for you to use. This stuff could include color\/camouflage schemes, weapons, armor, masks, clothes, among other things. This was an innovative feature in the game's multiplayer that was a major contributing factor in the games lifespan. To go with the persistence, there are several game modes that can be played. These include your team deathmatch, deathmatch, attack and defend, terrorist hunt, and other modes in a decent variety of maps to be played on. The highest player count to be achieved on the console versions of the game is 16.<\/p><h3>Modes<\/h3><p style=\"\">Rainbow Six Vegas features the following game modes:<\/p><ul><li>Attack &amp; Defend - Two teams fight for an objective.

Unlike previous titles, Most Wanted takes place during the day, and returns the police as a very real problem on the streets of the fictional city of Rockport. Most Wanted was well known for its police chases, though arguably it got more press for its FMV cutscenes, featuring live actors, than it did through anything else.<\/p><p style=\"\">Most Wanted is frequently compared to more recent games in the series, such as Carbon, ProStreet and SHIFT. Gaming press have claimed Most Wanted to be one of the best Need for Speed games of this generation, and it is normally the game most revered by players of the series.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/223550-nfsworldmap1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223550\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/223550-nfsworldmap1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223550\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/56\/223550-nfsworldmap1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>World Map of Rockport City<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Gameplay in Most Wanted features a free-roaming city, like that of <a href=\"\/need-for-speed-underground-2\/3030-9651\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9651\">Underground 2<\/a>. However, Most Wanted takes place during daylight rather than night. Across the city there are different types of races available to you, such as Drag and Circuit events. For the most part, Circuit races make up the main content of the racing, though there are other types of races that are encountered as well. One of the unique race events featured in Most Wanted is the 'Speed Trap' race. Along the route there are speed traps planted, and you must blitz through them at the highest possible speed. After speeding through all of the traps your total speed will be calculated, and the racer with the highest total speed is the winner. Below are all the race modes that exist in the game:<\/p><ul><li><b>Circuit<\/b><br \/>Circuit races have anywhere between 1 and 8 laps, and can range between difficult and easy opponents. There are 28 different Circuit tracks, and they will all eventually be encountered in Career mode. Circuit races are simply a matter of several different laps around the same course, and you must come first. It doesn't matter if you make it into first in the first corner or the final lap, as long as you're across the finish line on the final lap first.<\/li><\/ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913522-34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913522\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913522-34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913522\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3009\/913522-34.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><ul><li><b>Sprint<\/b><br \/>Sprint races act as the 'Point-to-Point' events of Most Wanted. There are 44 different tracks available for Sprint mode, and they play similarly to Circuit mode. It is simply a matter of reaching the finish line first. The only real difference between Circuit and Sprint events is that Sprint events can start and end anywhere, but they will never have a second lap to complete.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Drag<\/b><br \/>Drag races, that originated in <a href=\"\/need-for-speed-underground\/3030-12254\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12254\">Need for Speed: Underground<\/a> return again. Drag can be the most difficult discipline to succeed in if you are not comfortable with shifting gears manually. Unlike other modes, the car gears must be shifted manually, and revs play a large part in this. Depending on how high the car is revving you will get a prompt to shift. Shifts can either be poor, perfect, or late. Ideally you want Perfect Shifts across the entire race. Drag races can be the most scripted as well, as there will be vehicles scripted to drive out at certain times - trucks and trains are common for these, but with trucks you can drive through the gap under the trailer. There are 11 Drag strips to select from.<\/li><\/ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913506-21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913506\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913506-21.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913506\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3009\/913506-21.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><ul><li><b>Lap Knockout<\/b><br \/>Lap Knockout, or Elimination mode, as it is known in some games initially appears to be something similar to Circuit mode. And that is because it is a modified version of Circuit mode. At the end of each lap, the racer in last place is eliminated from the competition. Lap Knockout runs until there are two drivers left, and then it becomes a 1v1 event until the finish line is reached. In Lap Knockout, there are 20 different tracks to select from.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Speedtrap<\/b><br \/>Speedtrap events are all about speed. However, speed in these races needs to be balanced with acceleration and handling or you will find yourself behind everyone else. Speedtrap initially appears to be similar to Sprint as it uses the same tracks, but the way they are played is different. There are different speed traps laid out along the route, and the aim is to go through each trap as quickly as possible. Once the race is complete all your speeds are added up into one total, which is then compared against the other racers. The highest total speed is the winner. There are 31 Speedtrap track layouts in the game, and they are generally either similar, or directly from the Sprint events.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Unlike Underground, which featured no police presence, Most Wanted has a full police force that will do anything to stop street racers. Initially you will start off with basic patrol cars, but as you cause chaos you will move up the Rockport PD's 'wanted level', and more and more dangerous versions of police vehicles will arrive in an attempt to thwart your illegal efforts. In order to challenge other racers on the Blacklist and actually advance through the game, you will need to complete three different tasks set by that racer. Below is an example of the task layout:<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Bounty<\/b>: 10,000\/20,000<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Races<\/b>: 3\/4<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Challenges<\/b>: 2\/5<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913497-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913497\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913497-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913497\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3009\/913497-5.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">In order to challenge the other racer you must have completed all of the tasks: Bounty, Races, and Challenges. Bounty is earned from surviving in police chases for long periods of time, and it is extremely easy to rack up a huge bounty against the highest level of police enforcement if you are a good driver. For every five seconds you stay in the pursuit you will receive money added onto your bounty. Getting caught however, will forfeit any bounty you were earning during the pursuit though. In order to ease the difficulty of the police chase, there are some locations marked around the city with red triangles, that will only appear on your mini-map during a pursuit. These markers highlight the presence of 'Pursuit Breakers', which are traps that can be used to immobilize the police. Examples of a common Pursuit Breaker include water towers - smashing through the centre of a water tower will cause it to collapse, and scaffolding. Using Pursuit Breakers effectively is absolutely vital, as a good driver can potentially be in a chase for up to, and over, an hour. Breakers will not respawn during the same chase, so strategy is needed to use them to their fullest effect.<\/p><h2>My Cars<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5872\/288838-mostwanted025.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288838\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5872\/288838-mostwanted025.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288838\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5872\/288838-mostwanted025.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">My Cars is a mode that was added with Underground, and has made its presence in all Need for Speed games since. This mode allows the player to select a car, and then customize it with a limitless budget. Cars customized here cannot be used in Career mode, though it is a useful way of adding extra cars for use in Quick Races and Split Screen events. Cars here can be showcased and honed to perfection. In addition, you can install special parts from using the 'Burger King' challenge, which is accessed through inputting a code. These parts are known as 'Junkman' parts, and can provide a major bonus if they are installed after the Race parts for a car. My Cars features thirty slots for storing customized creations in, but they cannot be transported into your Career, so if there is a car you really like using it will have to be made again in Career mode.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913519-31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913519\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913519-31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913519\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3009\/913519-31.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The player arrives in <a href=\"\/rockport-city\/3035-39\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-39\">Rockport City<\/a> as a nameless street racer looking to make a name for themselves, driving a race version of the BMW M3 GTR. After first encountering a fellow street racer named <a href=\"\/mia-townsend\/3005-4522\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4522\">Mia Townsend<\/a> (Josie Maran) in a Mazda RX-8, the player is invited to race her and a friend named \"Rog\". After winning this race and earning some reputation, the player is pulled over by <a href=\"\/sergeant-cross\/3005-1487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1487\">Sgt. Cross<\/a>, the head of the Rockport Police Department's Street Racing Division and who drives a distinctive pursuit Chevrolet Corvette. Cross vows to arrest the player for street racing and strip down their car as soon as he can get enough evidence. The player then challenges <a href=\"\/razor-callahan\/3005-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3\">Clarence \"Razor\" Callahan<\/a>, who is the #15 racer on the Blacklist (a list of Rockport's fifteen most wanted street racers). After beating his cronies \"Ronnie\" and \"Bull\", the player goes up against Razor. However, Razor sabotages the player's ride, costing them the race and their car. To add insult to injury, the cops raid the finish line and everyone gets away except the player, who is arrested.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35321\/968820-1122391639.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968820\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35321\/968820-1122391639.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968820\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/35321\/968820-1122391639.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">After being released due to lack of evidence (because the player no longer has a car), Mia picks the player up from the police station in Rosewood and fills them in on the situation. While the player was locked up, Razor took their car and used it to climb to the top of the Blacklist. The player must now start from scratch and work their way up by defeating each racer on the list before they can challenge Razor again. Mia helps the player choose a new car and sets them up with \"safehouses\" in which to lie low between races in exchange for being able to set up \"side bets\" on the player's races. The player then works their way up the Blacklist, earning cars, parts and Police reputation, while Cross and Razor taunt the player through phone messages.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913523-35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913523\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3009\/913523-35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-913523\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3009\/913523-35.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Finally, the player challenges Razor again, on the same track as last time. After the player wins the race, Razor refuses to hand over the keys. Mia takes them from Razor anyway and when he attacks her, she subdues and handcuffs him while revealing herself as an undercover cop. As thanks for their \"help\" in taking down the Blacklist, Mia gives the player a headstart before calling in backup. Cross arrives and questions Mia as to the player's whereabouts (she says that the player \"got away\") before ordering the entire Police Department after them in a special Level Six pursuit.<\/p><p style=\"\">After five minutes in pursuit, Mia calls the player and tells them that their only escape from Rockport is by jumping a broken bridge to Palmont City. The player makes the jump and escapes town and the Rockport Police with the car.

Examples of Challenges are completing Speedtrap events with a total speed of over 1,000MPH on a certain track, or surviving in a police pursuit for 45 minutes. Challenges are unlocked through completing previous challenges, and they grow progressively harder as you advance.

Most Wanted uses Microsoft's 'TrueSkill' technology to find events that theoretically will not pit a highly skilled player against a new player, should you enter Ranked Matches. The other option are Player Matches, which are unranked and are simply for the experience and fun of a race against other human players. Online, many players use cars from the 'My Cars' section with the Junkman parts installed.<\/p><p style=\"\">Most Wanted was added to the Xbox LIVE 'Games on Demand' service for 2400 Microsoft Points, and is 6.8GB to download. If you install the disc of the game to your hard drive it will also require 6.8GB of storage space. The 360 version of the game features achievements, and is generally regarded as an easy game to earn the full 1000 Gamerpoints from, as all the achievements are unlocked through completing the story, making Multiplayer and Challenge Mode completely obsolete.<\/p><h2>Car List<\/h2><p style=\"\">As expected from a racing game, the cars available to you at the start are less than impressive, but it does not take much progression to begin to earn some higher quality vehicles. Though beating members of the Blacklist, you will unlock new cars in the Dealership and My Cars section to purchase. Oddly though, in the My Cars section some cars are pre-unlocked before having unlocked them in the Career (the Porsche Cayman S and Lamborghini Gallardo being two of these pre-unlocked cars).

Reflected off the design of the M3 is a customized Corvette - this is actually Cross' Corvette. Additionally, the manufacturer decals on the rear window of the GTR do not actually appear in-game, and the vinyl is a darker blue. Despite this, Most Wanted has a very distinguishable cover, and is easily identified.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Game Variants<\/h2><p style=\"\">Most Wanted was released in two variants: the Black Edition, and the Standard Edition. The Black Edition of the game has slightly different box art, with the words 'Black Edition' scrawled under Most Wanted in the same typeface. In-game, the Black Edition has two extra cars in the form of the 1960s Chevrolet Camaro and the Nissan 240SX. Despite this, these two cars are of no real use to career players, as they can only be used for Custom Races, Multiplayer. Black Edition games also come with two extra challenges, but nothing else. Most Wanted 5-1-0 is its own game, and although based in Rockport City as well, it does not count as part of Most Wanted.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>Some of the AI drivers will drive BMW M3s.

The first occurs early in the game, when a racer comments \"look what the Underground let loose, let's see how well you do in the daylight\", in reference to the player. The second reference comes late in the game, where Rog tells the player that \"people as far as Bayview are throwin' cash down on this\". Bayview was the city featured in Underground 2.<\/li><li>According to the unlock information for the C6-R Corvette you need 100% completion to access it.

It was developed by <a href=\"\/hothead-games\/3010-6333\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6333\">Hothead Games <\/a>and designed by Penny Arcade writer <a href=\"\/jerry-holkins\/3040-89527\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89527\">Jerry Holkins <\/a>and artist <a href=\"\/mike-krahulik\/3040-89528\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89528\">Mike Krahulik<\/a>. It was released on May 21, 2008 on Xbox Live Arcade, Windows, Mac, and Linux. The game was later released on the Steam platform, and it was announced that Episode One will be released on the PlayStation Network in Fall 2008. The team has stated that the game's story will be told over four episodes.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game starts out with you creating and naming a character from various physical attributes and pieces of clothing. Upon beginning the story, you'll quickly find that your home on the lovely Desperation Street has been flattened by a giant robot (specifically, a mammoth version of longtime Penny Arcade antagonist the Fruit Fucker). You'll soon join forces with PA main characters <a href=\"\/tycho-brahe\/3005-671\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-671\">Tycho Brahe <\/a>and <a href=\"\/jonathan-gabriel\/3005-1680\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1680\">John Gabriel<\/a>, paranormal detectives, as you investigate a mysterious infestation of mimes and smaller Fruit Fuckers throughout town.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18142\/599206-anneclaire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-599206\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/18142\/599206-anneclaire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-599206\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/18142\/599206-anneclaire.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The game's turn-based combat system.  <\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game play in Penny Arcade Adventures mixes elements of point-and-click adventures and RPGs. The player can click on objects in the game world to read clues and humorous descriptions, and smash objects such as crates and trash cans to obtain items. Enemies appear on the field, and you'll initiate combat as soon as you approach them. Battles play out in a menu-driven, turn-based fashion similar to those in many Japanese RPGs like Final Fantasy. Each of the three characters has unique weapons: Gabe uses his fists, Tycho has a Tommy gun, and your created character is armed with a rake. All three characters can also use special attacks periodically, and friendly characters such as the smug feline T. Kemper can be summoned to battle to perform humorous but sometimes ineffective support attacks.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/12090-pennyarcade_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-12090\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/12090-pennyarcade_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-12090\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/26\/12090-pennyarcade_05.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>An example of the game's dialogue trees.  <\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Battles gain a tactical element from the way the game handles action in combat. Each member of the player's party can spend a round of combat using an item, a regular attack, or a special attack. Each of these options is on their own separate timer, which slowly fills up over the course of battle. Item's take the shortest amount of time to be ready, so players can, if they choose, quickly heal or buff their team (or debuff their opponents). The regular attack takes a short amount of time, and does a normal amount of damage to one foe. The special attack takes the longest amount of time to fill up. Activating the special move triggers a short button pressing minigame. If the player can successfully complete the minigame without messing up, they will unleash the full power of the attack. If at any point the player messes up the minigame, than the special attack will not unleash the full amount of damage. As the game progresses, characters will gain more powerful special moves that require the player to complete harder minigames to activate the move's full affect. The player is encouraged to use these special moves, and to successfully complete the minigames, during combat by way of the Overkill system. If a special move manages to remove all HP from an opponent, the character who used the move will gain an overkill point, increasing their attack power by one. Tycho, Gabe, and the player's character can gain a total of 15 attack power through overkill moves in this episode. Overkill moves also cause the opponent to violently explode into chunks of blood\/oil\/rainbows.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once a character has used their action(item, attack, or special attack) all three of their actions reset and start filling up again. Players can extend the time they have to let a move charge up by using one of the three special character attacks (from T. Kemper, Anne, and Fuchsia). These attacks take longer to \"play out\" in battle, and the player can use these longer attacks to let the character\u2019s meters charge up a little longer.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4980\/245438-108258418446d1cee04394a1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245438\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4980\/245438-108258418446d1cee04394a1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245438\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4980\/245438-108258418446d1cee04394a1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Gabe and Tycho<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">While the game's combat encourages the players to use super moves, waiting around without performing a combat action can quickly lead to death, After the tutorial mission, enemies start hitting the player's team for high levels of damage. However, players can counteract this sudden rise in difficulty with a counter attack. By pressing a button just when an opponent's health bar flashes (just before the attack hits the character) the player can reduce the damage taken, nullify it, and even counter attack without wasting any of their move selections.<\/p><p style=\"\">Almost every opponent\/boss in the game has a weakness and a resistance to some attack\/item. Players will have to mix up their attacks (using regular attacks or special attacks, attacking an opponent with guns, rakes or fists, using item attacks) to deal the maximum amount of damage.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the beginning of combat, all characters in battle \"Roll for Initiative\" (a classic D&amp;D reference) to determine which character will attack first. If a character wins the Initiative roll, than they can attack or use an item right away. If a character rolls a natural 20, they can use a super attack at the start of the fight.<\/p><h2>Collector's Edition<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1992\/627373-paaotrspode1ce01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627373\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1992\/627373-paaotrspode1ce01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627373\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1992\/627373-paaotrspode1ce01.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Collector's Edition (Contents)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">A special Collector's Edition of Episode One was released exclusively at Penny Arcade Expo 2008 (PAX08), which was held August 29-31.

This time, the Nazis are attempting to harness the power of some sort of alternate dimension known as Black Sun. They can do this using lost artifacts, such as portals and medallions. You obtain a medallion in the early portions of the game that enables you to enter the Veil, a world that exists between the two dimensions. When in the Veil, you move more quickly, and you'll also earn additional veil powers, such as a shield, a damage increase, and the ability to slow time. Some of these powers are used for puzzle solving, others are better in combat situations.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unlike many first-person shooters, Wolfenstein has a hub or an overworld that you can freely roam in, and side missions that you can find by talking to people found in this hub. Typically, the hub--technically the streets of a fictional German town called Isenstadt--is there for you to talk to people, advancing the story, which in turn unlocks another mission. Isenstadt is broken up into multiple areas, separated by load times. The game will also stop to load when you enter an actual mission. The missions themselves are linear in the ways you'd expect from a first-person shooter. Along the way, you'll find gold, intelligence documents, and mystical tomes, all of which serve to unlock additional upgrades for your weapons and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2943\" href=\"\/the-veil\/3015-2943\/\" slug=\"the-veil\">    Veil<\/a> abilities.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Upgrades<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are eight known weapons to find in the world of Wolfenstein, not including grenades or a limited number of melee &amp; thrown weapons that can be utilized. Some are traditional World War II era Nazi guns and others are based on Veil technology, ostensibly created by some Nazi secret weapons project. Some of the different black powder based firearms available for use in Wolfenstein include the <a href=\"\/\/\/\">    MP40<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/\/\">    MP43<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/\/\">    KAR98<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/\/\/\">    Panzerschreck<\/a>. Some of the Veil-based weaponry includes the Particle Cannon and the Tesla Gun. All weapons, including grenades, can be <a data-ref-id=\"3015-133\" href=\"\/upgradeable-weapons\/3015-133\/\" slug=\"upgradeable-weapons\">    upgraded<\/a> at various <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1103\" href=\"\/shopping\/3015-1103\/\" slug=\"shopping\">    Black Market<\/a> locations found within the town of Isenstadt. Upgrades are purchased with money earned by completing missions, finding bags and bricks of gold, and completing side objectives as you come across various <a href=\"\/\/\/\">    NPC<\/a>'s in town. Before you are able to purchase upgrades for the different weapons you find in the game, you will need to unlock them by completing different objectives such as finding a certain number of pieces of intelligence, or completing a certain level.

Engaging this mode allows BJ to see into the world of the Veil, accessing passageways and seeing objects that normally would be invisible to the naked eye. There are numerous upgrades available for both the Veil medallion itself, and for the various Veil powers that are unlocked progressively throughout the game when the player finds the Mire, Shield, and Empower crystals. These powers can be used individually or in combination with one another, and when they are active it depletes the player's available veil energy. Veil energy is easily replaced by stepping into any of the common veil pools, which can be seen even when not in the Veil. Veil and crystal upgrdes are all unlocked by collecting hidden tomes throughout the world.<\/p><h3>Veil Medallion Upgrades<\/h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Inner Light<\/b> ($1500) - Increases available veil energy pool<\/li><li><b>Veil Sight<\/b> ($2000) - Allows BJ to see enemies through walls<\/li><li><b>Inner Brilliance<\/b> ($1500) - Increases veil energy beyond even what Inner Light provides.

The game lets you view a video when starting a new game called \"Previously on The Darkness\" which summarizes the plot of the first game. The plot is told through first person dialogue scenes (which can be skipped) and during loading screens where Jackie gives a monologue about what The Darkness is doing to him and how much he misses his now dead girlfriend, Jenny.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2123366-review_only_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123366\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2123366-review_only_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123366\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/39\/2123366-review_only_3.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Weird Visions.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game starts with Jackie going to dinner at an italian restaurant that he owns. It's suggested that he hasn't used The Darkness in quite some time, having realized that The Darkness was consuming him. While having diner with some pretty ladies, bullets start flying in the restaurant and a truck (which crashes through the restaurant) nearly kills him and horribly disfigures his leg. Having no other choice, he's forced to call upon The Darkness to survive the hit.<\/p><p style=\"\">After surviving the assassination attempt, Jackie and his crew search to know who ordered the assassination attempt. It's discovered that one of the patrons of the restaurant (Swifty) gave Jackie's position away to the assassins so Jackie decides to start his investigation by paying the patron a little visit. During his quest, Jackie has surreal visions of Jenny, where he reveals that he would rather live in an imaginary world with her than in the real world.<\/p><p style=\"\">Swifty is only a pawn to a larger association called the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood's leader, Victor Valente, wants the Darkness for himself in order to control the world. Jackie is captured by the Brotherhood and crucified. This kills Jackie and as the Darkness works on reviving him, Jackie is transported to a mental asylum. There, Jenny is a doctor while Jackie's men are all patients or guards of the mental institution. Jenny explains to Jackie that there is no such thing as the Darkness and he's not a mob boss. The Darkness is in fact a mental illness and Jackie's crazy. Jackie doesn't accept this but before he can ask more questions, he wakes up nailed to a cross in front of Victor. Victor uses a siphon to start extracting the Darkness. Jackie finds the strength to take the nails out of his hands and escape just as the Brotherhood attack his home and murder his aunt.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2123353-evolution0365.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123353\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2123353-evolution0365.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123353\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/39\/2123353-evolution0365.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Victor.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Dead set on getting even, Jackie attacks the Brotherhood head on. As he's doing this, he has vivid visions of Jenny and makes a trip to the asylum. Jackie begins to doubt his sanity, wondering if the Darkness isn't just something that lives in his mind. It's revealed that the siphon used to extract the Darkness can also make it stronger. The Darkness explains that it owns Jenny's soul and if he doesn't get the siphon, she'll rot in hell for eternity. It's also revealed that a polar opposite of the Darkness exists: the Angelus. The Angelus is, like the Darkness, a celestial being who wishes to fill the world with light. The Angelus can only use a woman as a host.<\/p><p style=\"\">Jackie is captured by the Brotherhood, put in an iron maiden and the Darkness is drained from him. He's saved by a darkling and manages to get the Darkness back. He finds out that Victor has brought him to his father's house (which is full of Darkness relics) and that Victor still holds a majority of the Darkness's essence and the siphon. Jackie eventually defeats Victor and gets the siphon back and in a sudden plot twist, Jackie kills himself as he knows that the siphon is the only thing that can permanently kill him and take him to the Darkness where Jenny is being held.<\/p><p style=\"\">Instead of ending up in hell, Jackie finds himself in the mental asylum. Realizing that the asylum and the visions of Jenny were all fabricated by the Darkness in order to keep him in check, Jackie commits suicide and ends up in hell where he defeats the Darkness by freeing Jenny. Jenny and Jackie spend a few final moments together before the screen fades to black.<\/p><p style=\"\">In a post credit cutscene, it's revealed that Jenny is the Angelus and that by defeating the Darkness, Jackie has paved the way for the rise of the Angelus. As a now transformed Jenny escapes hell, Jackie is left trapped inside the Darkness.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Darkness II is a first person shooter. The player controls Jackie from the first person perspective. The gameplay focuses mainly around gunplay and using The Darkness. Jackie can pick up any firearm and can dual wield smaller weapons such as uzis. Ammo can be picked up off enemies or by finding ammo crates. Jackie can carry two light weapons plus a large firearm (shotguns &amp; assault rifles) at a time.<\/p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3015-2100\" href=\"\/the-darkness\/3015-2100\/\">The Darkness<\/a> is what sets <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1422\" href=\"\/the-darkness\/3025-1422\/\">The Darkness<\/a> from other first person shooters. Acquired roughly 15 minutes into the game, it can only be used in the darkness which encourages the player to shoot out lights and destroy generators scattered around the environment. The Darkness is comprised of two sentient tentacles that can be independently controlled with two different triggers or keys.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2123357-evolution0402.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123357\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/39\/2123357-evolution0402.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123357\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/39\/2123357-evolution0402.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Dinner time.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The left head can be used to grab objects and people. Once grabbed, the object or person can be thrown or devoured. Throwing objects can be useful since they can impale enemies or cut them in half. Devouring enemies can be used to gain health or ammo. The animation is different and is determined by which part of the body you grabbed the enemy by (legs, torso or head). Finally, objects such as car doors can be grabbed and used as shields.<\/p><p style=\"\">The right head is used to strike enemies and destroy barriers and objects. Controlling this tentacle is similar to analogue combat in Dead Island. Pressing the right trigger and a direction on the analogue stick causes the tentacle to swipe up, down, left or right. This sometimes slices weakened enemies in half or can be used to slam air born enemies to the ground, sending out a shockwave that stuns other enemies. The strike tentacle can also be used to stun an enemy so he can be grabbed by the grab tentacle.<\/p><p style=\"\">Across the majority of the story, Jackie is accompanied by an AI-controlled Darkling. He will primarily follow to give support, such as attacking an enemy allowing Jackie to grab him, or will at least provide comic-relief (such as urinating on corpses) and act as a guide, showing Jackie where to go next. Through a specific upgrade, Jackie is eventually able to pick up the Darkling like any other object and throw at an enemy, which will result in the Darkling beating his prey to death. The Darkling can be temporarily 'killed', even by the player, but will always resurface soon after.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2206578-darkling_render06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2206578\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2206578-darkling_render06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2206578\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/10354\/2206578-darkling_render06.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>'ello, monkey.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">On two occasions during the story, the player will gain control of the Darkling after he is forced to separate from Jackie. Because of his small stature, the player is encouraged to play stealthily during these segments - moving through air vents and executing enemies from behind. Should the player wander into a light source, they will quickly die. Though much like when he's an AI companion, the Darkling will respawn soon after should he perish, with all of the player's kills persisting no matter how many times they may die.<\/p><p style=\"\">Throughout the game, Jackie will earn \"Essence\", which serves as the game's currency for upgrades. The upgrading system is made up of four \"trees\", with each tree associating to a specific field of Darkness abilities. The player spends their accumulated Essence points towards various upgrades of their choosing. For instance, some abilities allow Jackie to replenish additional health by devouring the hearts of those he kills, while other abilities grant the player a physical shield, protecting them from projectiles. The game allows the player to respec as they choose, at the cost of additional Essence points.<\/p><h2>Vendettas<\/h2><p style=\"\">Vendettas is a mode where the player plays as one of 4 hit men who each have specific Darkness powers and go on missions for Jackie. The Vendettas campaign happens at the same time as the game's main campaign and focuses on securing dark relics from Brotherhood agents. The campaign can be played offline alone or online co-operatively with other people (there is no split-screen). There is also a hit list option where players can replay specific missions from the Vendettas campaign as well as new ones specific to the Hit List mode. Each character has their own upgrade tree.<\/p><h3>Characters<\/h3><h4>Inugami<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2206629-dii_vendettas_inugami1_610x343.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2206629\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10354\/2206629-dii_vendettas_inugami1_610x343.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2206629\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/10354\/2206629-dii_vendettas_inugami1_610x343.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Out to get revenge for the murder of his family, Inugami sports a darkness imbedded samurai sword (Kusanagi) as well as the ability to sprint longer and use the swarm ability.

The list was set up in conjecture with a trivia contest, which promised to cross off names of non playable characters in the game as the community correctly answered trivia questions related to the franchise.

Though many suspected the footage of being fake, its validity would be confirmed when Sega asked 1UP to remove the screens and video later that day.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1817\/1316840-fakesonicscreen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316840\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1817\/1316840-fakesonicscreen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1316840\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/1817\/1316840-fakesonicscreen.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A \"screenshot\" of Super Sonic fighting Eggman that was later revealed to be a fake.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">From late February to early March, various small leaks about the game's content were brought to light, including screens of the game's first boss (Dr. Eggman wielding the wrecking ball <i>a la<\/i> the first boss encounter in <i>Sonic the Hedgehog<\/i>) and a list of the game's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-29\" href=\"\/achievements\/3015-29\/\">achievements<\/a>, revealing that the player could freely transform into Super Sonic once all the Chaos Emeralds were collected as in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1662\" href=\"\/sonic-the-hedgehog-2\/3030-1662\/\">Sonic 2<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4628\" href=\"\/sonic-the-hedgehog-3\/3030-4628\/\">Sonic 3<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18115\" href=\"\/sonic-knuckles\/3030-18115\/\">Sonic &amp; Knuckles<\/a>. However, some hoax leaks, such as the screen shown to the left, came out at this time as well, bringing the truth of these leaks into question.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately for Sega, the floodgates opened on March 28 when Sonic 4's entire soundtrack was leaked in the <i>Sonic 4<\/i> thread on Sonic fansite and fangame community <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sonicretro.org\/2010\/03\/sonic-4-soundtrack-ripped\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonic Retro<\/a> by a poster using the pseudonym \"infinity.\" This leak provided two interesting facts for those following the game: that each zone would have its own unique musical track, similarly to how <i>Sonic 3<\/i> and Sonic &amp; Knuckles presented a new version of the music from the first Act of a Zone in Act 2; and that the speculations on the content of the game since the February 16 leak--that the game would only consist of the four Zones shown and that the Special Stages were a redux of <i>Sonic the Hedgehog<\/i>'s Special Stages--were true. Two days later, infinity leaked a play-through of the entirety of \"Splash Hill Zone, Act 1.\" The next day, infinity released videos of the rest of the Zone. The rest of the game would follow shortly thereafter.<\/p><p style=\"\">The footage leaked by infinity was from a later, possibly near-final build of the game that contained various changes from the footage leaked on February 16. These changes include slight alterations to the jumping physics from the first footage, an altered Level Select screen that added \"Final Zone\" and removed the ability to play any Special Stage, and the addition of a targeting reticule for the homing attack. infinity's leaked footage, like the February 16 footage, was taken from the Xbox 360 build of the game, though infinity's footage was filmed from a Standard Definition display while the February 16 footage was widescreen. Both leaks were the result of users pulling the entire game from PartnerNet, Microsoft's press- and developer-exclusive <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\" href=\"\/xbox-live\/3015-1404\/\">Xbox Live<\/a> network for beta-testing <a data-ref-id=\"3015-329\" href=\"\/downloadable-content\/3015-329\/\">downloadable content<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"\/xbox-live-marketplace\/3045-86\/\">Arcade<\/a> games. PartnerNet is typically only available to those with Xbox 360 debug kits, meaning that the leaks either came from a press or developer partner, or (more likely) a user with a modded 360 who hacked their way past PartnerNet's security checks.<\/p><p style=\"\">These gradual leaks continued until the last leaked footage - the final boss, the end credits and the reveal for Episode II that one is shown if they beat the game with all the Chaos Emeralds - was posted on April 3. With that last post, footage from every Act and one of the Special Stages had been posted for all the internet to see; most of the entire game had been shown months before it was even to be released.<\/p><p style=\"\">This disastrous leak did not go unnoticed. Shortly after the final footage had been released, Sonic Retro put forth an ultimatum, threatening to permanently ban anyone discussing <i>Sonic 4<\/i> on the forum in any capacity. Additionally, PartnerNet was briefly shut down from the night of April 3 to the morning of April 4. This led to speculation that Sega had threatened Sonic Retro, who had previously allowed the footage to be posted and even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sonicretro.org\/2010\/03\/new-sonic-4-assets\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">advertised the leaks on their main page<\/a>, with legal action if they did nothing to silence the leaks, and that Microsoft had begun an investigation into discovering the leaker's identity. Sonic Retro <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sonicretro.org\/2010\/04\/sonic-4-why-we-did-what-we-did\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">officially commented on the matter on April 5<\/a> and made it clear that Sega had not contacted them about the leaks and that the extreme action taken was their idea alone. In a post on the home page of the site, site administrator Scared Sun commented:<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\">Because the leaks we had experienced prior to this week fell under things we felt were non-damaging and potentially helpful (early video, text of achievements, pictures, music), we took no direct action. Nearly all of these leaks also originated at Sonic Retro and this was something we did not have a problem with, as we did speak to each person who leaked these assets privately. However, throughout this past week, one of our members decided to continue leaking videos to a point where essentially the entire game was shown, and we felt that crossed a line that we could no longer morally support and pulled discussion entirely.<br \/><br \/><b>-Scared Sun, site administrator of Sonic Retro.<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote><p style=\"\">Since this ultimatum, Sonic Retro has allowed discussion of Sonic 4 to recommence. An explanation as to why PartnerNET was taken offline the night of April 3 has never been given.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the month-and-a-half following the infinity leaks, various livestreams of the entire game and higher quality footage leaks occurred, though nothing of any significance came out of those leaks and livestreams except for confirmation that infinity was not pulling an elaborate hoax.<\/p><p style=\"\">Images and unlock conditions of the 360 version's two <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3749\" href=\"\/avatar-awards\/3015-3749\/\">Avatar Awards<\/a> - a Sonic costume split into a head and body portion - were leaked by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xboxresource.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?f=134&amp;t=2915&amp;sid=1551e2407d1ad4ef146e047312bcd2ca\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox Resource<\/a> on April 4, 2010.

Instead of the promised summer release, the game would be released in the fall in order to give the development team time to fix elements of the game based on the \"fan feedback\" provided from the leaked footage. Sega outlined two areas in which the game will receive substantial changes:<\/p><ul><li>The game's physics would be further altered to bring them more in line with the physics of Sonics 1-3K and CD (see the \"Differences Between Versions\" section for more information).<\/li><li>Two levels would be replaced. The leaked PartnerNET build contained two \"gimmick acts\" with radically different gameplay: \"Casino Street Zone: Act 2,\" in which Sonic is placed in a small pinball area and the player must score 100,000 points to finish the level, and \"Lost Labyrinth Zone: Act 2\"--the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchgear.com\/2010\/04\/05\/video-sonic-4-footage-has-a-mine-cart-a-mine-cart\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">infamous mine cart level<\/a> in which the player moves Sonic's mine cart by \"tilting\" the world and occasionally making him jump. These two acts--\"Lost Labyrinth Zone: Act 2,\" especially--were ravaged by fans and became cornerstone arguments in \"the case against Sonic 4.<i>\"<\/i> These two acts would become exclusive to the iPhone version (and subsequent Android and Windows Phone 7 ports, which were based on the iOS release) of the game.<\/li><\/ul><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1817\/1480032-pic02_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1480032\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1817\/1480032-pic02_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1480032\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/1817\/1480032-pic02_08.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>And yet there's still a mine cart.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Sonic 4's Japanese website was updated on August 18, 2010 with a new batch of screenshots highlighting Lost Labyrinth Zone. Of these screens, three showed a level in which Sonic must carry a torch to light his way through a dark level and light dynamite. In the two months that followed, Sega \"rerevealed\" the game, issuing new trailers and screenshots for each of the game's four zones. Like Lost Labyrinth Zone before it, the information drop for Casino Street Zone showed a new level (this one involving Sonic running on a bridge of playing cards) that fans following the leaks would later discover was, in fact, the console versions' replacement for the score challenge stage that was originally Casino Street Zone's second act.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game was finally released on October 7, 2010, launching first on the iTunes App Store. Console versions were released the following week, becoming downloadable on WiiWare, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on October 11, 12, and 13 respectively. The Android version dropped the next month, releasing on November 8. Windows Phone 7 and PC versions followed much later, releasing on June 15, 2011 and January 19, 2012 respectively. No other leaks occurred between Sega's official response and the final game's release.<\/p><h2>Differences Between Versions<\/h2><p style=\"\">Though all versions of Sonic 4: Episode I are mostly identical, there are some key differences between the console and mobile releases of the game. As previously mentioned, the mobile versions of Sonic 4 contain the two \"gimmick acts\" from the leaks that caused massive outcry: \"Casino Street Zone: Act 2\" and \"Lost Labyrinth Zone: Act 2.\" Neither of these acts are found in the console versions of Sonic 4, while the replacement acts found in those two versions are not in the iOS version. Additionally, the world map used to choose zones is not in the mobile versions, which instead features a level select screen identical to the one from the February 16 and infinity leaks. Furthermore, while all versions of the game use pre-rendered sprites for background and foreground elements, the mobile versions, strangely, use fully-rendered polygonal models for Sonic, Eggman and enemy <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2978\" href=\"\/badnik\/3015-2978\/\">badniks<\/a> instead of the pre-rendered sprites used by the console releases. Some have argued that these prove that the iOS version is the beta version that would have originally been released had the game not been delayed on account of the leaks. However, perhaps due in part to the difficulty of comparing physics in a game controlled with a controller to one controlled with virtual buttons on a touchscreen, this argument has remained speculation.<\/p><p style=\"\">The four console releases are identical with a few exceptions: the PlayStation 3 and WiiWare releases feature optional motion control for special stages using <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5310\" href=\"\/sixaxis-support\/3015-5310\/\">SIXAXIS<\/a> and the Wii Remote's tilt control respectively. The WiiWare version, as standard for all <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"\/wii\/3045-36\/\">Wii<\/a> games, has a maximum output resolution of 480p while the other three versions can output up to 1080p.<\/p><h2>Avatar Awards<\/h2><p style=\"\">Like many games, the Xbox 360 version has two exclusive unlockable award items that players can use to outfit their avatars.

While searching for the beast, Zahra tells the Prince that the genies once lived in Izdihar, but were all killed by the Haoma.

Scoring and chaining together kills, completing objectives and performing \"breach spikes\", essentially an active reload, will all produce adrenaline, recharging your applications.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/135472\/2119113-syndicatedartv5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119113\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/135472\/2119113-syndicatedartv5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119113\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/13\/135472\/2119113-syndicatedartv5.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The DART Overlay in action<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The campaign provides access to four key abilities:<\/p><ul><li><b>DART Overlay<\/b>: Slows down time and highlights targets in the environment, even behind cover. With upgrades, it can mitigate damage, increase health regeneration, and increase damage output.<\/li><li><b>Backfire App<\/b>: This application causes the gun of an enemy to misfire, initially affecting two targets, but can be upgraded to three. Those effected suffer a small amount of damage from the initial blast and are susceptible to increase damage.<\/li><li><b>Suicide App<\/b>: This application disrupts DART chips' regular functions, causing the effected target to pull out a grenade and commit suicide.<\/li><li><b>Persuade App<\/b>: A throwback of sorts to the original Syndicate, this application causes a target to switch sides and fight alongside you. In the event that all enemies are eliminated, the target will turn the gun on themselves.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The ability to \"breach\", or hack, in to enemy chips and the environment around you plays an integral part in gameplay as well. Several enemies will sport armor types that negate all damage until they are hacked, and often times progress through a level will be hindered until a computer terminal, control switch, etc. is hacked to open up the pathway.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game also consists of a four player cooperative mode that follows the loose story of up and coming Syndicate, Wulf Western and it's agents: Akuma, Thalos, Fall and Darius. Players are able to create different loadouts, making weapon and application combinations that all them to potentially fill a team archetype, e.g. Tank, Healer, etc. Because the multiplayer is not competitive based, there is no Online Pass required by EA to access the multiplayer content.<\/p><h2>Co-operative Mechanics<\/h2><p style=\"\">The co-operative mode in Syndicate is designed for 4 players but skilled players can tackle the missions solo or in pairs and still have great success in earning experience. Any experience earned will be lost if a player does not finish a given mission so be sure to keep that in mind if you need to leave a game in progress. The experience earned goes towards player rank, weapon upgrades and application research. Each rank provides points which can be spent in a skill tree to increase the attributes of the player, such as faster breach speed, increased health, the ability to equip two applications at once and even temporary invulnerability when near death.<\/p><p style=\"\">Each mission can be played on one of three difficulties: Normal, Hard and Expert with each jump providing stronger enemy types and more of them to deal with. Usually this includes more of the armored enemies that usually require focused teamwork to take down. During the higher difficulties it will be more likely that a player is put into a downed state and thus will need a \"reboot\". During the initial downed phase a player may move around, albeit very slowly, and attempt to get close to an active player to be \"rebooted\". If any more damage is sustained the player will drop to their knees and a longer reboot will be needed.<\/p><p style=\"\">Two main types of mission objectives are employed in co-op. One will require you to perform combat sweeps of a given area \/ facility and eliminate any hostiles found within. The second will task you with retrieving items of value \/ interest and delivering them safely to a waiting dropship.<\/p><p style=\"\">After a mission is beaten on a specific difficulty the player will earn application research tokens which allow for the improvement of the abilities that can be equipped before entering a mission. Each application can be improved 4 times from the base effect. The player can choose which upgrade will receive priority if mulitple research projects are unlocked and a single project can be queued to earn experience after the main designation is complete. If the designated and queued research finish during a mission then any further unlocked projects will receive research in a sequential fashion until a priority is chosen by the player.<\/p><p style=\"\">The armored enemies carry powerful weapons and are immune to most forms of damage until their armor is breached or bypassed by the player agents. Once a breach occurs a layer of the armor is weakened and the players have a set amount of time to destroy it and damage the health of the enemy. The strongest type of enemy has 3 layers to breach and on the third breach they are disabled allowing the players to remove their chips.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/135472\/2016870-syndicate_screenshots_coop_final02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2016870\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/135472\/2016870-syndicate_screenshots_coop_final02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2016870\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/13\/135472\/2016870-syndicate_screenshots_coop_final02.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Agent Fall getting his chip rip on<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Removing a chip from a downed elite soldier will unlock blueprint tokens that will allow players to unlock upgrade paths for weapons and start to designate earned experience towards unlocking the upgrades. Experience continues to accrue towards ranks but now also goes towards unlocking scopes, silencers and other upgrades for each weapon in the game. This research can be designated and queued in an identical fashion to application research.<\/p><p style=\"\">The player can edit and save 3 distinct loadouts consisting of a main weapon, sidearm and one (or two) applications. The weapons available are of a limited selection and many must be found within missions. Any upgrades applied to these retrieved weapons will apply upon picking them up during the mission. The dropped weapons can include a Thermite gun ( flamethrower ), Rocket launcher, Minigun and more. The more powerful weapons can not be refilled at the ammo crates that dot the mission layout.<\/p><p style=\"\">The applications that can be taken into the co-op mode are generally unique to the co-op apart from Backfire, which appears in the main campaign. There are 12 applications in total:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Backfire:<\/strong> Hacks enemy weapons and makes their ammo explode, forcing them to the ground and making them more vulnerable to damage for a time.<\/li><li><strong>Focus Target:<\/strong> Highlights a target and increases damage done on the hacked target by a given amount.<\/li><li><strong>Battery:<\/strong> Recharges fellow agents applications a given amount but can not be used to refill another application of Battery.<\/li><li><strong>Focus Breach:<\/strong> Decreases breach time for all fellow agents.<\/li><li><strong>E-Drain:<\/strong> Damages enemies and converts that damage into health for the player.<\/li><li><strong>C2C Pulse:<\/strong> Healing waves pulse from the player, healing anyone near to them by a given amount.<\/li><li><strong>Reboot:<\/strong> Allows a player to revive themselves from a downed state.<\/li><li><strong>Damage Link:<\/strong> Increases weapon damage of all players for a time.<\/li><li><strong>Shielding:<\/strong> Provides a temporary shield to all players that absorbs a set amount of damage.<\/li><li><strong>EMP:<\/strong> Releases an EMP charge around the player that can stun enemies and disable turrets and UAVs.<\/li><li><strong>Squad Heal:<\/strong> Heals all players by a set amount.<\/li><li><strong>Virus:<\/strong> Infects enemies with a damage over time effect that can even penetrate armored enemies without breaching first.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Before entering any mission a player may form or join a player created Syndicate. This is the clan system of the game and brings bonuses to the player in the form of increased experience from healing and rebooting fellow Syndicate members during missions.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game ships with 9 maps, that are billed as \"reimaginings\" of some the original Syndicate's mission: Western Europe, Mozambique, Atlantic Accelerator, Colorado, China, Scandinavia, Northern Territories, Argentina and New England.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">EA's<\/a> <a href=\"\/jeff-gamon\/3040-16934\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16934\">Jeff Gamon<\/a> has stated that,<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\">\"Fans of the franchise will recognize many weapons and environments in the game, but in a whole new way.

The key to keeping the game going is to alternate between the two halves of the level without missing any pellets.<\/p><p style=\"\">Pac-Man has a new ability which allows him to drop a bomb, by dropping a bomb he can remove all the moving ghosts and send them back to the Ghost house, they will eventually all come back out still following Pac-Man in a train.

Alma will appear in tense moments of the game in an attempt to startle or frighten the player. Examples of this are hallways filled with blood, random lights flickering, and voices coming from dark corners. Some hallucinations contain elements that can injure or kill the player, making them more than a simple <a href=\"\/scripted-events\/3015-2039\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2039\">scripted event<\/a>, and keeping the player perpetually on their toes.<\/p><p style=\"\">A large part of this is due to the claustrophobic level design &amp; aesthetic, which has the player constantly weaving through small dark hallways, offices, dingy industrial areas, and worn-down condemned buildings.

Only really useful in the earlier game when enemies have little armor.

Feathering the trigger makes it burst fire. Soldiers field this weapon frequently, making ammo easy to find. While very good against many lighter opponents its armor-piercing capabilities are lackluster and must be supplemented for heavier engagements.<\/li><li>G2A2 <a href=\"\/assault-rifle\/3055-413\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">Assault Rifle<\/a> - The Replica standard issue. This rifle is the most well-rounded of all the guns; good range, good accuracy, good damage, good AP. There is a weapon superior to it in every category, but none more universal. This weapon also burst fires if the trigger is quickly tapped.<\/li><li>Combat <a href=\"\/shotgun\/3055-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">Shotgun<\/a> - Probably the most useful weapon throughout the majority of the campaign. Will instantly <a href=\"\/gibs\/3015-334\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-334\">gib<\/a> any enemies at close range, and has a decent medium range as well. Pump-action and per-slug reloading make multi-target engagements difficult, but the Combat Shotgun excels in any short-term conflict.<\/li><li>HV Penetrator - An extremely powerful <a href=\"\/nailgun\/3055-722\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-722\">nailgun<\/a>, and frequently used by the heavy Replica soldiers. This weapon has no recoil and perfect accuracy at any distance. When a standard enemy is killed by a nail it <a href=\"\/impaling-weapon\/3055-1395\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1395\">pins<\/a> them to the wall.

This weapon is rare as well as dangerous for its user, making it an uncommon choice in the arsenal.<\/li><li>Particle Cannon - An incredibly powerful beam cannon. It will instantly kill any standard human enemies, leaving behind a scorched skeleton. The Particle Cannon is the only perfectly accurate weapon in the game, making it a great sniping substitute to the ASP rifle when ammo for the ASP is not available.<\/li><li>Repeating Cannon - A very strong cannon with a large clip, it is effective at taking down larger opponents. Its collateral damage is significant, so close-range fire is discouraged.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/grenade\/3055-111\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">Frag Grenades<\/a> - A short-fused handheld explosive.

They make formidable foes if the player is not equipped to deal with them.<\/li><li>Assassin - Quick moving assailants. They have the ability to cloak, and get up close to do melee attacks.

Make quick work of them with the <a href=\"\/shotgun\/3055-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotgun<\/a>.<\/li><li>ATC Security - Regular human enemies. They are the security guards of Armacham, and will occasionally get into 3-way fights with the replica soldiers.

Their projectiles are near unavoidable without SlowMo.<\/li><li>Stationary Turrets - Protecting Armacham facilities, these turrets drop down the ceilings to wail on you with gunfire. They are very accurate and hard to destroy, but their activation switch is rarely far from the turret itself and should be sought out quickly after seeing one.

The main story really begins when Diana informs 47 that they are the only two left in the agency. It is implied that the others have been systematically wiped out by Mark Purayah II and <a href=\"\/mark-parchezzi-iii\/3005-3753\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3753\">Mark Parchezzi III<\/a> - two of The Franchise's best assassins.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Diana finally decides to close down the agency but not before she gives 47 one final contract. This is the mission \"A Dance with the Devil\", where 47 must infiltrate a party at the CIA headquarters and take out the assassins who are trying to kill him. Once this is complete he and Diana split the funds and go their separate ways.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After what seems to be 47's final contract he is approached by an old CIA acquaintance named Smith (who 47 has previously rescued from a rehabilitation clinic in the mission \"Flatline\"). He requests that 47 take on a mission to kill the men who are trying to assassinate the President of the United States. These men are Vice President Daniel Morris and <a href=\"\/mark-parchezzi-iii\/3005-3753\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3753\">Mark Parchezzi III<\/a>, who are both working for Alpha Xerox. This is a political organization which owns \"The Franchise\" and wish to monopolize the cloning facility that created 47. They want the President taken out before the elections so that he is definitely not elected and so he cannot forward his pro-cloning policy. This would prevent Alpha Xerox from attaining the monopoly on cloning.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932950\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932950\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During this mission 47 successfully kills Morris and also finally takes down Parchezzi in a shootout on the roof of the White House. After this mission a newspaper article is shown which states that the authorities believe Parchezzi to be Morris' assassin. As he is now being hunted by both enemy operatives and the police 47 retreats to his hideout. Here he is approached by Diana without warning which instantly arouses his suspicion as they rarely meet face to face. She proposes a plan which should secure both of them safety from \"The Franchise\". As 47 is considering the idea and reading the briefing he expresses his doubts about its success. However, before he can say any more Diana injects him with what seems to be a poison. 47's body is quickly surrounded by SWAT members, and Diana, announcing that bringing down 47 was \"surprisingly pleasant\" is inducted into \"The Franchise\" by Cayne, it's founder.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After this event the plot suddenly returns to present day, with Cayne and Rick Henderson, where 47's body is about to be cremated so that rival cloning companies cannot take a sample of his bone marrow and no more non-defective clones can ever be made. Diana approaches 47's body and places his signature <a href=\"\/amt-hardballer\/3055-483\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-483\">Silverballer<\/a> pistols on his chest during his funeral and kisses him after applying lipstick. It then becomes clear that the \"poison\" that Diana used on 47 was actually a fake death serum which is used earlier in the game and that her lipstick contained the antidote. This shows that this was Diana's true plan to save them both and she did not betray 47. The game can then end in one of two ways. As the player watches 47 lying on a pedestal before he is cremated a faint heartbeat can be heard. If the player does not react in any way then 47 will be lowered into the crematorium and will perish. However, if the player keeps spinning both of the analog sticks then 47 will come back to life and the player will have to control him as he takes out all of the witnesses to his revival. Many of the witnesses try to escape but it becomes apparent that Diana has locked the gates of the exit and no one survives except 47 (and Diana, who had left earlier).<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game ends with a cut-scene in which Diana states that she has made the Agency operational again using the funds of \"The Franchise\". She is on the phone with someone who she refers to as \"Your Majesty\". Diana then says to this mysterious person that the Agency has lost track of 47. The game finally ends with 47 in a brothel having a conversation with a traditionally dressed Chinese man on what can only be assumed is another job.<\/p><h2>Missions<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The missions during the game are listed below, along with a brief overview of how they are tasked, and the intel that can be purchased in the pre-mission briefing. Typically, the missions occur in order of difficulty though for the inexperienced or violent player, <i>A Vintage Year<\/i> can pose more problems than some other missions due to the small corridors of the house and the guards who are armed with shotguns and the SAF SMG.<\/p><h3>The Death of a Showman<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Death of a Showman is the tutorial level for Hitman: Blood Money, and is intended to introduce the player to the mechanics of the game, such as poisoning food or water. The mission involves assassinating Joseph Clarence, better known as 'Mr. Swing King', after an accident at his amusement park caused the deaths of several children. One vengeful parent decides that Mr. Swing King should be punished severely. Enemies during the level are gang members, as the amusement park is being used by a 'Mr. Scoop' in order to produce drugs under a supposed agreement that will allow Clarence to restart his amusement park. The Death of a Showman is considered by players as a poor tutorial, as it encourages killing enemies who do not otherwise need to be killed to complete an objective. For example, one of the instructions is to kill two gang members in a room with a shotgun, before hiding the bodies. It would theoretically be possible to continue without having to kill them. The Death of a Showman has no intel, and does not need to be completed for Xbox 360 <a href=\"\/achievements\/3015-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements<\/a> related to completing the game on different difficulty settings. It is not possible to receive a rating on this level.<\/p><h3>A Vintage Year<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A Vintage Year is the first 'true' mission of the game, and places Agent 47 in <a href=\"\/chile\/3035-3002\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3002\">Chile<\/a>, during a wine convention held by one Fernando Delgado. His son, Manuel, is using the vineyard as a front for distributing cocaine. Only Fernando was requested for execution by a client, though it is viewed as safer to eliminate Manuel as well, in order to make it appear as a drug-related killing. The mission introduces a camera, used by a Chilean television crew who are present at the event. As usual, Agent 47 should be avoiding the cameras to complete the hits set out. To escape, players depart using a seaplane which has docked at the vineyard.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Due to the nature of this mission, it is one of the hardest missions to play aggressively. Guards are armed with the pump-action shotguns, while VIP Guards wield the SAF SMG. Unusually the VIP Guards are less well armed than the standard guards due to the relatively tight confines of the villa, where the shotgun can do the most damage. VIP Guards have access to the villa and drug lab though standard guards do not. A Vintage Year is the first mission where a player can earn the Silent Assassin rating, and also introduces intel you may buy to make your mission easier to complete. The intel is copied directly from the game below.<\/p><h4>Intel<\/h4><ul><li>The guided tour of the wine cellar might prove useful, especially when looking for potential death traps.<\/li><li>We've heard that Manuel likes to entertain friends and enjoy the merchandise in the wine cellar.<\/li><li>The entrance to the secret lab is hidden somewhere in the wine cellar.<\/li><li>The insides are guarded by highly trained guards.<\/li><li>Cost is $3,500 each<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Cost for all Intel<\/b> = $14,000<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Grand Total<\/b> = $14,000<\/p><h3>Curtains Down<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1513641\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1513641\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Tenor Alvaro 'Alvade can be seen in position alongside the executioner<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Curtains Down opens in the Paris Opera House. Agent 47 has been tasked to assassinate two men: Richard Delahunt, and Alvaro D'Alvade. Richard Delahunt is an American ambassador with a fascination for D'Alvade, who is performing as the tenor in <i>Tosca<\/i>, which is being performed. Agent 47's chance to strike comes when the tenor faces a firing squad, and strike he does. The two men supposedly run a child trafficking ring in Eastern Europe, and a client has requested their death. Agent 47 is dispatched to make this a reality.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is during Curtains Down that we first see specialized bodyguards protecting Delahunt. It is possible to dress as the executioner and shoot Alvaro yourself, though it is much easier to simply replace the prop Mauser pistol he uses with a real pistol that can be attained through talking with the secretary. It is also possible to take 47's talents onto the stage by dressing as one of the supporting actors, and taking a prop rifle. You may then stand and watch Alvaro's death at the hands of his unwitting killer.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is possible to complete this mission in less than a minute, though with a very low rating. If a player is on a low difficulty, they can shoot their way in to the box where Delahunt watches from, and then shoot Alvaro D'Alvade as he acts his role on the stage. This method ceases to work on higher difficulties, where Agent 47 will be killed before being able to line up a shot with Alvaro on the stage below, or before he can reach the exit again. It is entirely possible to finish the mission in this manner on both Easy and Normal difficulties though is not recommended for Expert or Professional levels for obvious reasons.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Completing Curtains Down with a Silent Assassin rating is difficult due to the vigilant guards and long time spent waiting in order to ensure all enemies are in position for you to make your moves. The approach involves replacing the executioner's pistol with a real World War I-era handgun so that he will shoot D'Alvade dead. When Delahunt runs towards the scene he will trip on the carpet, so the chandelier above can be rigged with an RU-AP Mine to eliminate him as an 'accident'.<\/p><h4>Intel<\/h4><ul><li>The content of toolboxes will not be searched when you are frisked.<\/li><li>There is a lift shaft from the backstage area to the stage.

To smuggle Smith out, you will need an experimental serum that will give him the appearance of being dead, without actually killing him. This is because the facility Smith has been checked into is renowned as being the toughest rehab clinic in the United States.

Given a new identity and home by the government, his ex-compatriots want him dead before he gives a court hearing against them. Agent 47 is the go-to guy to making snitches disappear, so Sinistra is no different. He is holding a birthday celebration for his daughter, and this provides an ample time to eliminate him. However, his wife possesses a piece of information that would still be of value regardless of Vinnie's position in the world: on it, or buried in it. It is a piece of microfilm, hidden in her necklace. It is vital that this microfilm is removed from the crime scene, lest the evidence contained be used to convict Sinistra's ex-allies.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Despite the birthday party being clearly intended for a young girl (there is a clown as an entertainer), there is no child present in the level due to the media controversy it would cause.<\/p><h4>Intel<\/h4><ul><li>Garbage trucks can dispose of all kinds of waste.<\/li><li>The surveillance team has an unhealthy appetite for donuts.<\/li><li>Vinnie has complained about the neighbor's son taking pot shots into the garden with an airgun.<\/li><li>Vinnie lives close to a veterinary surgeon.

Members of the shadowy 'Alpha Xerox' group intend to put a permanent stop to his election campaign, lest he poses a threat to them later in their plans. 47 has been contracted to eliminate all those who intend to cancel the election speech.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The key members of the attack, and the guards, are dressed as birds. The 'crows', as the hit-squad are known, communicate via walkie-talkie. Mark II is the mastermind behind the assassination, while Raymond Kulinsky acts as the shooter. Angelina Mason does not provide a major role, unless she discovers Kulinsky's death, in which case she will stab the senator to death, sacrificing herself to complete their mission. It is utterly vital that the politician, and his float, are protected during the celebrations.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a bonus, a case of blood diamonds are changing hands during the festivities, and Agent 47 will be paid extra should he manage to bring them as well. The diamonds are carried by a red bird seen in the hotel at the beginning of the mission, and he will take them across to Mark II by the bookshop. It is possible to intercept him on the way there or walk out, killing Mark II and taking the diamonds as well. Entering the area without the diamonds as the red bird will cause the AI to begin demanding the diamonds on a constant loop, meaning the mission will be virtually impossible to finish.<\/p><h4>Intel<\/h4><ul><li>Walkie Talkies transmit everything - even background sound and music, which could reveal someone's location.<\/li><li>Clubs usually have a back entrance for the staff.<\/li><li>Bookstore walls are like paper - you can overhear what's going on next door.<\/li><li>Clubs in this area are known for having hat-dress codes and music themes.<\/li><li>Some private apartments have a useful view.<\/li><li>Pianos can kill - especially when they are dropped from the sky.<\/li><li>A guy dressed as a yellow bird checked into a hotel room a couple of hours ago.<\/li><li>Cost is $3,500 each<\/li><li>Cost for all 7 = $24,500<\/li><li>Grand Total = $122,500<\/li><\/ul><h3>You Better Watch Out..<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Lorne de Havilland is a porn tycoon, who is holding a Christmas party at his reclusive mansion.

There are six key members of the gang, and Skip Muldoon himself. With all of these keys removed, the Gator Boys have no hope of survival.

A female assassin called Eve, and a male assassin called Maynard John become targets as well. Eve likens herself to a spider, and Maynard John has a passion for the theatrical, referring to Agent 47 as 'less than human'. John challenges Agent 47 to a duel, in the Hell Party.

Requiem is considered as a canon mission, and among those eliminated is Rick Henderson. <a href=\"\/diana-burnwood\/3005-1841\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\">Diana Burnwood<\/a> is not present, as it appears she ensured 47 could accomplish this feat, using the serum that was seen during 'Flatline'.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The gameplay in Blood Money follows the same path as the previous Hitman games in many regards. The basic concept remains the same, you must take out your mark(s) any way you see fit. The way you go about this is entirely up to you and the game this time around gives you even more options then the previous Hitman games to leave your personal touch.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One new game mechanic is the ability to use 'environmental' kills, i.e. rigging a bomb to a beam and then waiting for the right moment to remotely detonate it and take out your mark. Another new feature is the ability to customize your weaponry and gadgets. This can consist of larger magazines, red dot and laser sights, better silencers, armor piercing rounds which can go through doors and Kevlar vests, and many more tweaks. Other new abilities 47 has is the ability to take hostages, throw weapons and bombs, and the much welcomed close combat attacks. Nothing feels better than head butting someone and then punching them in the face, or the ability to grab a threats weapon while elbowing them in the face in the process (however you always take the chance that they may pull the trigger, resulting in alerting nearby guards).<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194695\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194695\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another new addition to gameplay is the concept of witnesses, which are any AI character(s) who witness you do something violent during a mission and survive to talk about it. Witnesses can negatively impact your overall rating at the end of a mission, so in many cases you must be even more careful in Blood Money then in previous Hitman games. However a witness is no longer a threat if they are dead\u2026<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Which brings us to another new concept in Blood Money, your notoriety level. Your notoriety is dictated by the number of witnesses that are alive at the end of any given mission. Your notoriety will carry through to the next mission you attempt, the higher your notoriety the more likely someone will be able to see through your disguise and identify you as a fugitive. However, one can always opt to decrease their notoriety at the end of each mission, for a price.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The newspaper is another new game feature which the player gets to see at the end of each mission, which describes the murder(s) they committed. The newspaper can also offer a deeper back story of the mark(s) you just took out and the articles surrounding the main article are usually an entertaining read as well as hinting at what will happen in later missions.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Blood Money contains an assortment of upgradeable weapons, which players may choose to bring along when on a contract. To upgrade a weapon, the player needs money, which is attained from successfully completing missions. Each weapon has 5 levels to upgrade, with each level increasingly more expensive.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>Level 1<\/th><th>Level 2<\/th><th>Level 3<\/th><th>Level 4<\/th><th>Level 5<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>$50,000<\/td><td>$75,000<\/td><td>$100,000<\/td><td>$150,000<\/td><td>$200,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are 5 unique upgradeable weapons. To fully upgrade all weapons it would cost $7,075,000. However, you can steal enemy weapons and use those. No collected weapons can be modified though, and the majority of the weapons are not suppressed, making poor choices for use during an assassination, unless compromised.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/amt-hardballer\/3055-483\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-483\">AMT Hardballer<\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The AMT Hardballer is an American-made <a href=\"\/m1911\/3055-61\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-61\">M1911<\/a> clone.

Upgrades make it one of the most versatile weapons in the entire game, and potentially the best all-rounder as well. It can even be used to make shorter range sniper shots, as well as acting as a close range machine pistol depending on how it is configured.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Level<\/b><\/p><\/td><td><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Upgrade<\/b><\/p><\/td><td><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Description<\/b><\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>1<\/b><\/p><\/td><td><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Low Velocity Ammo<\/p><\/td><td><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Low Velocity ammo is one of the two initial upgrades available for the AMT Hardballer, and is almost completely essential.

It does not make a visual change to the weapon, and allows you to carry two additional magazines. The actual quantity of extra ammunition carried changes depending on whether or not Extended Magazines is also used. If not, you will carry 18 additional rounds - two magazines. If it is equipped, you will have 36 rounds, which is still two (larger) magazines.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"\/laser-sight\/3055-1819\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">Laser Sight<\/a><\/p><\/td><td>The laser sight is mounted below the barrel of the gun, and allows for more precision when firing.

The most controversial advert read 'Beautifully Executed', and featured a woman lying on a bed, apparently asleep.

Taking this criticism seriously, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\" href=\"\/blizzard-entertainment\/3010-1088\/\" slug=\"blizzard-entertainment\">Blizzard<\/a> radically overhauled the game in game play and in visuals.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unlike the two mostly similar races featured in WarCraft II, StarCraft would focus on three distinct races that required very different play-styles and strategies. Also, StarCraft would later adopt an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-246\" href=\"\/isometric-viewpoint\/3015-246\/\" slug=\"isometric-viewpoint\">isometric view<\/a>, pre-rendered <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2288\" href=\"\/digitized-sprites\/3015-2288\/\" slug=\"digitized-sprites\">sprites<\/a> and backgrounds, creating a new visual style far removed from that of WarCraft II.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Both the original release and the expansion pack, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5415\" href=\"\/starcraft-brood-war\/3030-5415\/\" slug=\"starcraft-brood-war\">StarCraft: Brood War<\/a>, feature three full campaigns, one for each race. Unlike many other RTS games, StarCraft places a very heavy focus on massing large armies of units. Although micromanagement is crucial to defeating advanced players, it is not as central to the game play as in games such as the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-648\" href=\"\/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war\/3025-648\/\" slug=\"warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war\">Dawn of War<\/a> series. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-975\" href=\"\/resource-gathering\/3015-975\/\" slug=\"resource-gathering\">Resource management<\/a> is vital to success, however players are only given two resources to manage: <a data-ref-id=\"3015-573\" href=\"\/minerals\/3015-573\/\" slug=\"minerals\">minerals<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-444\" href=\"\/vespene-gas\/3055-444\/\" slug=\"vespene-gas\">Vespene gas<\/a>. Minerals are used to buy units and are used heavily throughout the game, while Vespene gas is often used for the research of more advanced units in the later stages of a match.<\/p><p style=\"\">The reason that StarCraft is still played over 10 years later is because of its extraordinary unit balance. Each unit for each race has a legitimate counter, and there is no strategy that is guaranteed to make a player victorious time after time. Only by truly out thinking one's opponent will one emerge victorious. Of course, professional players and online veterans have developed advanced strategies after many years of practice, so the game continues to evolve and change.<\/p><p style=\"\">The early game forces players to focus on setting up a base, laying out a defensive network, building units quickly, and securing reserves of minerals and Vespene gas. The Zerg units can be built the most quickly, causing Zerg players to often rush an opponent in a move known as the \" <a data-ref-id=\"3015-686\" href=\"\/rush\/3015-686\/\" slug=\"rush\">Zergling rush<\/a>.\" After the first few minutes of gameplay, the Protoss gain the advantage with their powerful <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5195\" href=\"\/zealot\/3015-5195\/\" slug=\"zealot\">Zealot<\/a> units which can devastate buildings and basic units. Finally, the Terrans gain the upper hand, with the quickest access to middle-end units such as Siege tanks and Vultures.<\/p><p style=\"\">The middle game focuses on resource management and expansion. The Terrans arguably have the strongest middle game since their buildings are mobile and their units are not prohibitively expensive. The Protoss and Zerg both have a slight lull between their initial tier of units and their advanced units.<\/p><p style=\"\">The late game favours the player that has managed the early and middle game the most efficiently. The Zerg and the Protoss are arguably the best late game races due to their very powerful units. While the Terrans do have <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4207\" href=\"\/battlecruiser\/3055-4207\/\" slug=\"battlecruiser\">Battlecruisers<\/a>, they are no match for a fleet of fully upgraded Protoss <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4194\" href=\"\/carrier\/3055-4194\/\" slug=\"carrier\">Carriers<\/a>. In fact, a properly managed group of 12 Protoss carriers with minimal backup (some distracting units and detector units) can often decimate an entire battlefield of bases.<\/p><p style=\"\">A typical match lasts between 20 and 90 minutes, with the ideal number of players being between 2 and 4. Larger games of 6 to 8 players are exciting with team play or when all players are of a similar skill level. Of course, some matches will last only 5 minutes if a player is effective at rushing and another player is not mindful of setting up a defensive network. Matches can last several hours if all players are very low on resources, very rich, have few attacking units, or have heavy defensive networks. The vast majority of matches end up in a single victorious party, but between 5 and 10% of matches will end in a mutually agreed upon draw.<\/p><h2>Races<\/h2><h3>Terrans<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8180\/352452-terran.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-352452\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8180\/352452-terran.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-352452\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8180\/352452-terran.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Terran Marines.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Terrans are a colony of humans and use fairly standard units and tactics in terms of RTS games. Terrans are generally considered to be the most defensive race in the game, as they possess many assets which can make their bases especially difficult to penetrate. Bunkers can be filled with up to four basic ground units and may be quickly repaired by their worker units. They offer excellent base defense, particularly when backed up by Siege Tanks. Siege Tanks, while unable to attack air units, have the longest attack range in the game and deal massive damage to ground forces. Many Terran structures also have the ability to fly and relocate, although they move rather slowly.<\/p><p style=\"\">Terrans also have many methods of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-11\" href=\"\/cloak\/3015-11\/\" slug=\"cloak\">cloak<\/a> detection and also tend to be the most micromanagement intensive race when it comes to combat. Even their most basic units, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5194\" href=\"\/marine\/3015-5194\/\" slug=\"marine\">Marines<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5219\" href=\"\/firebat\/3015-5219\/\" slug=\"firebat\">Firebats<\/a>, have a researchable activated ability Stim Pack which heals units makes them considerably more effective in combat if used at the right time.

Combining elements of the Stealth-Action, Beat-Em-Up, Shooter, and Racing genres, Beyond Good and Evil was hailed by critics as one of the best games of 2003. The critical acclaim, however, didn't translate into impressive public response. As a result BG&amp;E suffered disappointing sales across the PS2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC. Despite this however, a sequel for the game has been in development for some time, partly as a result of a barganing arangement within Ubisoft steming from Michael Ancel's dissapointment with <a href=\"\/rayman-raving-rabbids\/3030-21617\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21617\">Rayman Raving Rabbids<\/a>.

The only force that can stand against the might of the invaders is the Alpha Sections.

Reports, mostly surfacing from an underground newspaper published by an organization known as the IRIS network, suggest that the Alpha Sections aren't as effective as they would have the populace believe. The reports claim that the Alpha Sections arrive at the scenes of attack too late to do any damage to the DomZ forces and question how dedicated General Keck is to eradicating the Alien attackers.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14912\/620162-tv2008082915451200.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-620162\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14912\/620162-tv2008082915451200.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-620162\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/14912\/620162-tv2008082915451200.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Pey'j's shoe looks just like my camera...<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Enter <a href=\"..\/..\/jade\/94-787\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jade<\/a>, a young woman living on a small lighthouse Island near the city of Hillys. With her Uncle <a href=\"..\/..\/peyj\/94-800\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pey'j<\/a>, Jade has taken it upon herself to protect all the children made orphans since the DomZ invasion. While enjoying afternoon meditation, she witnesses a large DomZ strike force descend from the sky. Activating a defensive shield (to protect the island from the artillery barrage) Jade is informed that her bank account is empty, and the power company won't supply her necessary energy for the shield leaving the island exposed to attack. The alien forces land on the island, and Jade, along with Pey'j, manage to defeat the DomZ soldiers before they abduct the orphans. Upon defeating the DomZ (and defeating a boss that crash landed deep into the surface of the island), the Alpha Sections arrive at the island and begin to take credit for Jade and Pey\u2019j's actions.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14912\/620245-tv2008083011081800.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-620245\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14912\/620245-tv2008083011081800.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-620245\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/14912\/620245-tv2008083011081800.png\"><\/a><figcaption>If only I had a cardboard box.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the fallout of the attack, Jade receives two messages. The first is from a biologist asking her to take photographs of every unique species of life on the planet for financial reward (Jade uses this money to restore the functionality of the shield). The second message comes from a mysterious gentleman who tasks Jade with photographing a pair of alien monsters in the Black Isle Mines to prove that DomZ have already settled on the planet Hillys. The adventure, as Jade comes to find out, was a test by the IRIS network, a group of agents who suspect that the Alpha Sections are behind many of the DomZ kidnappings. Asking her to sneak into government facilities to photograph any evidence of malfeasance, Jade is soon roped into a conspiracy that will send her all over Hillys, and even to the dark side of the moon.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Beyond Good &amp; Evil combines aspects of a number of game genres for various styles of play. These include sneaking, fighting, racing, photo-snapping, and shooting.<\/p><p style=\"\">Jade spends the majority of the game sneaking around the various Alpha Section facilities, avoiding the heavily armed Alpha Sections guards. She can press herself up against walls, crawl through gaps, and roll to quickly avoid being detected. If needed, Jade can \"quietly\" take out the armed Alpha Sections soldiers by sneaking behind them and kicking their large air tanks. One hit to the tanks will cause green smoke to rupture from their helmets. As the soldier begins to run around and restore the proper air pressure, a second hit will cause the soldier's gas tank to burst, rocketing them to the sky before they explode.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the game's boss fights (as well as any other battles) Jade will pull out her \"Dai-Jo\" staff to battle with the enemies. Jade doesn't lock onto enemies, but can very easily switch the target of her attacks by pointing the analog stick towards a different opponent. Actual battle, often compared to combat in the 3-D Legend of Zelda games, has Jade dodging around attacks and attacking enemies when an opening appears. There are also other items that Jade can use in and out of combat that are collected throughout the game such as the disc shooter.<\/p><p style=\"\">Jade often enters combat alongside Pey'j and Double H. These A.I controlled companions will help Jade find openings against targets.<\/p><p style=\"\">The key goal of Jade's missions are taking pictures of any suspicious activity inside the Alpha Section bases and exposing the conspiracy.<\/p><p style=\"\">Since Jade is a photographer, much of the game takes place behind a camera lens. Like the <a href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">N64<\/a> game <a href=\"..\/..\/pokemon-snap\/61-10024\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Pok\u00e9mon Snap<\/i><\/a> and the <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PS3<\/a> game <a href=\"..\/..\/afrika\/61-21236\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Afrika<\/i><\/a>, Jade can take pictures of various animals. Taking a picture of one of these animals results in financial reward which is used for purchase of new items.<\/p><p style=\"\">Pearls are another form of currency found throughout the world. They can be obtained by defeating bosses, winning races and finding secret caves and sections of the city. Pearls are mainly used to upgrade Jade's hovercraft, giving it new capabilities that open up new sections of the world.<\/p><p style=\"\">The actual game world of Hillys is a large ocean (divided into several \u201cmaps\" by loading screens), filled with tiny islands and alcoves for Jade to explore via hovercraft for new upgrades and finding new species of animal to photograph. There is also the main city of Hillys which is often returned to for mission updates and item purchase.<\/p><p style=\"\">Towards the end of the game, the hovercraft merges with a large spacecraft - the Beluga. This allows Jade to fly into space for the final mission of the game.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1718753-beyondgood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1718753\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1718753-beyondgood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1718753\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/6\/62890\/1718753-beyondgood.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Soundtrack CD Cover<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/ubisoft-entertainment\/3010-82\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\">Ubisoft<\/a> officially released this <a href=\"\/original-soundtrack\/3015-189\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">soundtrack<\/a> by <a href=\"\/christophe-heral\/3040-89650\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89650\">Christophe H\u00e9ral<\/a>, allowing it to be legally download for free.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>Track<\/th><th>Title<\/th><th>Length<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>01<\/td><td><b>In the Beginning<\/b><\/td><td>2:27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>02<\/td><td><b>Dancing with Domz<\/b><\/td><td>4:36<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>03<\/td><td><b>Home Sweet Home<\/b><\/td><td>2:51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>04<\/td><td><b>Hyllian Suite<\/b><\/td><td>4:37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>05<\/td><td><b>Mammago's Garage<\/b><\/td><td>2:37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>06<\/td><td><b>Isle de Noir<\/b><\/td><td>4:25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>07<\/td><td><b>Mineshaft Madness<\/b><\/td><td>2:47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>08<\/td><td><b>Say Cheese, Fellas<\/b><\/td><td>1:59<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>09<\/td><td><b>Akuda House Propaganda<\/b><\/td><td>2:41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10<\/td><td><b>Ancient Chinese Secrets<\/b><\/td><td>3:00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11<\/td><td><b>Don't Fear the Reaper<\/b><\/td><td>6:38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12<\/td><td><b>Fear the Reaper<\/b><\/td><td>2:02<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13<\/td><td><b>Fun and Mini-Games<\/b><\/td><td>1:54<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14<\/td><td><b>Funky Bar 100<\/b><\/td><td>2:43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15<\/td><td><b>When Domz Attack<\/b><\/td><td>1:27<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>16<\/td><td><b>Slaughterhouse Scramble<\/b><\/td><td>2:14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17<\/td><td><b>Sneaky Jade Suite<\/b><\/td><td>3:14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>18<\/td><td><b>Organic Beauty<\/b><\/td><td>1:55<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>19<\/td><td><b>Violent Jade Suite<\/b><\/td><td>5:23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20<\/td><td><b>Heart of Darkness<\/b><\/td><td>4:35<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>21<\/td><td><b>Metal Gear Domz<\/b><\/td><td>2:38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>22<\/td><td><b>Something Completely Different<\/b><\/td><td>1:52<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>23<\/td><td><b>Behind Enemy Lines<\/b><\/td><td>3:23<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>24<\/td><td><b>Free Your Mind<\/b><\/td><td>1:20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>25<\/td><td><b>Thoughtful Reflections<\/b><\/td><td>3:03<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>26<\/td><td><b>Enfants Disparus<\/b><\/td><td>2:34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>27<\/td><td><b>Above and Beyond<\/b><\/td><td>5:44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>28<\/td><td><b>Unacceptable Losses<\/b><\/td><td>2:08<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>29<\/td><td><b>In Hot Pursuit<\/b><\/td><td>1:16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30<\/td><td><b>Sins of the Fathers<\/b><\/td><td>3:50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>31<\/td><td><b>Redemption<\/b><\/td><td>1:53<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><ul><li><u>Total Running Time<\/u>: 93 minutes 46 seconds<\/li><\/ul><h2>Beyond Good &amp; Evil HD<\/h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/ubisoft-entertainment\/3010-82\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\">Ubisoft<\/a> re-released Beyond Good &amp; Evil in High Definition on <a href=\"\/xbox-live-marketplace\/3045-86\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">XBLA<\/a> on March 2, 2011 at a price of 800 <a href=\"\/microsoft-points\/3015-5685\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5685\">MSP<\/a>.

The game end in cliffhanger fashion and it has never been attempted by the show or the producers of the show to explain the mystery that is Elliot Maslow.

The player is allowed to explore and talk with them, or even trade items and goods for things more useful to the player. The core of the game, however, is centered on adventure and exploration. The game is by no means open-ended, but the player will find a variety of locations that also appear in the television show, accurately recreated. Places such as the initial site of the crash, the \"dark territory,\" the Hatch, and many of the Dharma stations all make an appearance. A few extras that haven't been seen before are also thrown in for good measure (though some do not belong in the canon).<\/p><p style=\"\">The main gameplay features include traversing the jungle and evading the smoke monster, navigating through pitch-black caves, and solving puzzles that come in the form of arranging fuses to transfer power to items that helps the player progress, such as opening doors. Lost: Via Domus also uses \"episodes\" to advance the plot, rather than just moving on to the next level. At each new episode, you are given a recap of the previous section. This is done to simulate watching the actual television series.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Game also features \"Flashback\" Levels in which you must take photos of a certain objects to help Elliot regain his memories, or collect clues often in the form of a written document. Once the \"Flashback\" is completed, a scene will follow that furthers the plot.<\/p><h2>Character Voices<\/h2><p style=\"\">While featuring more than 15 characters from the television series, most of the voices are not provided by the original actors.

This man apparently knows Elliot, but before anything is resolved the plane rips in half, oxygen masks are down, and the Pilot of the show is relived. Elliot blacks out and mysterously finds himself unharmed and unable to remember anything. As he wanders about the Jungle he sees aperations of a woman, but Elliot is never able to confront her. Eventually he finds Kate, who triggers the game's first flashback. In this flashback Elliot, waiting on the Flight 815 plane, is taking pictures of Kate. The player's job is to focus the camera on Kate's handcuffs, which when successfully done reveals that Kate is a fugitive being watched by a Federal Marshall. Back on the island, Elliot promises to Kate that he will not reveal her secret to anyone.<\/p><p style=\"\">He proceeds to follow the blonde Labador \"Vincent\" towards the plane crash.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1335740-942291_20080122_thumb002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335740\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1335740-942291_20080122_thumb002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335740\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/63109\/1335740-942291_20080122_thumb002.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Elliot can meander with several of the crash members, but it is until he can speak with Jack is he given a quest. That quest is to stop the fuel leak on the Airplane, which introduces the puzzle system. With a handful of fuses, Elliot must not only connect the fuses to the right spot but also connect them with the proper voltage. More fuses and more lines on a fuse (So a single fuse take up less electricuty than a a four way fuse) take up more voltage. Upon solving and reporting the fixed leak, Jack diagnoses Elliot lack of Memory as amnesia. He recomends that Elliot finds some of his old belonging to reignite his memory.<\/p><p style=\"\">Kate is one to talk to. She tells him to look in the jungle for a backpack that might be his, but while searching for it Elliot is attacked by a mystery man who threatens to kill him if the camera is not returned.<\/p><h3>Episode Two: A New Day<\/h3><p style=\"\">This episode takes place between: \"Pilot Part 2\" and \"White Rabbit\"<\/p><p style=\"\">Episode Two begins in grand fashion with Charlie, Kate, and Jack running out of the jungle, scared from their previous encounter with the \"Monster\", and without the transciever that they had found in the cockpit. Jack immediately blockades the entrance to the Jungle, fearing that the survivors might wander into the jungle and be attacked by the \"Monster\". This is a quandry because Elliot has remembered that the Flight Attendant stowed away his laptop in the cockpit section, the section that Elliot needs to reach, and the section that Jack is not letting any one go near.<\/p><p style=\"\">Elliot then sees the apperation he saw in the jungle standing on the beach.

Upon approaching her a flashback is triggered where Elliot, relaxing on a beachside porch, is watching this same woman dance around quite happily on the sand. They seem to be in a relationship. Once Elliot takes a picture of her, and gathers several notes about a \"Hanso\", a scene is triggered where Elliot and \"this special someone\" steal a boat to explore a nearby island. On the actual Island, Elliot decides to lie to Jack to get past him. He tells Jack that Claire has fainted, and once the ruse works Elliot is back in the jungle. He survives both a \"Other\" marksman, a dark cave, and a chase with the smoke Monster in his Journey to find both his laptop and camera; however he is ambushed by Ben, Tom, and Juliet at the end of the episode. His laptop is damaged severely.<\/p><h3>Episode Three: Via Domus<\/h3><p style=\"\">(The \"Way Home\" in Latin, and the game's name)<\/p><p style=\"\">This episode takes place between: The timeline is unknown, but Elliot sees a fully excavated hatch which is first seen in that state in the episode \"Deus Ex Machina\".<\/p><p style=\"\">The survivor's have begun to distrust Elliot due to the recent events with Ethan Rom (A other that infiltrated the Lost camp) and they do not think Elliot was on the plane. However, he finds help from Sayid, who can fix his laptop if he finds a usable battery. Locke may have one, but he holds<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1341092-lostvd062.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1341092\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1341092-lostvd062.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1341092\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/63109\/1341092-lostvd062.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">the belief that Elliot should start a new life on the island. This triggers a flashback back in Sydney, where he is spying on Lisa Gellhorn who is the woman that Elliot keeps seeing on the island. She is trying to get information from the shop owner but more important to the current situation is Locke, who is seen in a wheelchair, trying to sell camp equipment. When Elliot confronts him about his handicapped state back on the Island, Locke tells him he will help if and only if he passes through the cave. During the journey to cave, Elliot sees a fully excavated hatch, and upon giving some criptic advice and more journeying Locke reachs the Cave. If Elliot can pass through this cave unharmed by both \"The Others\" and the\" Smoke Monster\".<\/p><p style=\"\">The \"Smoke Monster\" briefly attacks Elliot, Lisa makes cryptic appearances, and Elliot finds a skeleton at the end. In the skeleton's hand is a compass with the words \"Via Domus\" enscribed upon it. Lost takes this as a sign that \"The Island provides\" and gives Elliot the batteries.<\/p><h3>Episode 4: Forty-Two<\/h3><p style=\"\">This episode takes place between Exodus Part II and sometime before the Tailies arrive in \"The Other 48 Days\"<\/p><p style=\"\">As Elliot examines his compass on the beachside he hears an explosion from the jungle. His compass points in that direction. Hurley confirms that the hatch has been happened. Then an unexplained amount of time passes as the survivors are now pressing the button regularly and Sayid is spending most of his time in the Hatch. Sayid will fix the laptop if he can prove he was on the plane. Talking to Hurley will trigger a flashback of Rico's pawnshop (the previous flashback scene) where Elliot blackmails Rico with pictures of him cheating on his wife. Rico knows that an important deal went down in room 42 of the Persephone Hotel, between Zoran Savo and other influential businessmen. Lisa bursts in claiming the story was hers, though Elliot is defensive of his motives. In this flashback Elliot Maslow learns a very important thing - his name. Upon telling Sayid - and Sayid checking for Elliot's name on the flight manifest - Sayid lets him into the Hatch.<\/p><p style=\"\">Elliot explores the hatch while Sayid fixes his laptop. While in there he can do a number of things: enter 4 8 15 16 23 42 to reset the computer, follow his compass to a barricaded, concrete filled doorway, and tinker with the electrical panels that puts the station in lockdown. Elliot has 4 minutes to enter \"Via Domus\" into the computer and unlock the blast doors. This brief tension is ultimately irrelevant to the plot of the game, for as soon as he unlocks the door Jack and Sayid burst in. They fixed his laptop and they found information on Sarin gas and explosives. Until answers are found the plan on keeping Elliot locked in the armory.<\/p><h3>Episode V: Hotel Persephone<\/h3><p style=\"\">Unknown: but Elliot's captivity mirrors that of Ben's in \"One of Them\"'<\/p><p style=\"\">Elliot wakes up in the Armory and has visions of Lisa. The lights turn on, Lisa disappears, and Elliot attempts to talk to Kate through the armory door. She trusts him due to the fact that Elliot kept her fugitive secrect safe, though the one question that matters is \"Let me out\". This prompts a flashback of the Persephone Hotel Lobby, where Savo's deal is going down in room 42. Lisa decides to help Elliot once he tells her that Savo killed her sister, though this may be a lie. The man who had previously assaulted Elliot is guarding the room, and with Lisa's help, they distract him and Elliot sneaks into room.<\/p><p style=\"\">With this information Elliot convinces Kate to release him and soon Elliot is prancing around the jungle. Using a previously found map he finds a building by the hatch, but no matter of gunfire will open the locked door. Elliot needs something stronger. The survivors back at the beach are wary of his presence but will not attempt to apprehend him. Hurley tells him there is dynamite at the Black Rock, and upon finding and using this dynamite Elliot is able to open the doorway. There he discovers the incident room. A large malfunctioning reactor is drawing his compass in, though that stops when he deactivates the reactor on a nearby terminal. With a functioning compass he is able to \"Follow his way home\", before he leaves the terminal beeps. A message appears, \"Elliot Maslow. We know what you did. We will kill you\". This message is presumably from the others.<\/p><h3>Episode VI: Whatever it Takes<\/h3><p style=\"\">Also unknown.<\/p><p style=\"\">Elliot, with little left to follow, uses his compass as his guide. It leads him to sonic fence that surrounds the barracks, otherwise known as \"Otherville\", and here is where the smoke monster ambushes him. The Smoke monster had previously been attacked him on his journey here, yet when it finally has him Smokie decides to let Elliot live. The reason is unknown. Juliet approaches the fence and tells Elliot that he is the one responsible for Lisa's death. This triggers a flashback where Lisa and Elliot have one more guard to distract - the man who had attacked Elliot on the island. Lisa's attempts to distract him does not work, but Elliot attempts do. He tells a guard that Elliot is a journalist, and she is soon apprehended. This saves Elliot from being apprehended.<\/p><p style=\"\">Back on the Island Julliet tells Elliot that he can come through. Ben wants him for an unknown reason. She leads him to an underground station that leads to the Flame Station. There he finds Mikhael at gunpoint. The man who has the gun is the same man who attacked Elliot on the beach. Elliot saves Mikhael by killing this man. \"Thank-you, but I am sorry,\" Mikhael tells Elliot as he gets hit by a dart.<\/p><h3>Episode VII: Worth a Thousand Words<\/h3><p style=\"\">This episode takes place near the end of \"Live Together, Die Alone\"<\/p><p style=\"\">This episode starts much like many of the others, a cryptic vision of Lisa. The only thing that has changed since Persephone is that Elliot is now locked up in the Hydra Station instead of the Swan Station. Tom (Mr.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1342096-942291_20080122_screen024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1342096\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1342096-942291_20080122_screen024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1342096\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/63109\/1342096-942291_20080122_screen024.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Lisa Gellhorn<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Friendly) comes in to ask Elliot a few questions about Lisa and Hanso<\/p><p style=\"\">which conveniently triggers an explanation about Lisa and Hanso. Thomas Mittlewerk, the president of the Hanso Foundation, gives Savo a briefcase full of Sarin. This is a deadly nerve gas. Elliot s watching from a concealed location as Lisa come's in, two guards in her hands. Back on the Island Elliot realizes something - he killed Lisa. Thomas extorts him to Ben who has a proposition for him; Elliot will be allowed to leave if he exhorts Jack to the Black Rock (the 18th century ship where Elliot found the dynamite).<\/p><p style=\"\">Elliot returns to the beach, promising a way home to Jack. Jack follows him to the captain chamber's in the Black Rock where the Others reveal they have Kate hostage and at gunpoint. Jack realizes what has happened when Tom hands Elliot his compass, saying that he may go home now. A flashback stalls the action for a moment, showing Elliot the final scene in the Persephone. Savo is interrogating Lisa to the whereabouts of Elliot, though she does not give in, and ultimately dies. Elliot takes a picture of Savo shooting Lisa, from his hiding spot, and back on the island he realizes that he let Lisa die to take a picture of Lisa dying. The ultimate story. Virtue strikes in Elliot as he decides to free Jack and Kate by shooting an explosive case of dynamite, knocking out the Others (and unfortunately Elliot). Elliot is left unconscious because Jack does not want to save someone he considers a liar. Juliet however, find him and tell him that the rest of the Other's plan on killing him. He needs to follow the compass bearing to a boat, where he can then follow the bearing of 325.<\/p><p style=\"\">The final action scene is Elliot running through the jungle, dodging gunfire from Others, until he reaches the docks. At the docks Locke is there - for an unknown reason - and begins to fight off the Others for him as Elliot leaves the island. As he sailing forth the sky begins to shake and a purple\/white hue takes over everything. A loud noise encompasses everything as well, mimicking the day the Swan Station imploded, and one thing Elliot can make out is a new plane coming towards the island - about to crash. Elliot then wakes up to find himself on the beach, having just crashed on a different plane. Lisa, very much alive, is standing over him. \"Oh my god, we made it!\" She yells and so ends the game.<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Homages to the Show<\/strong>The first episode of the game is rife with homages to show. Elliot wakes up on the Island, the camera is focused on his pupil ( Perhaps the most common shot in the show)<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1335606-lostvd003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335606\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63109\/1335606-lostvd003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1335606\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/63109\/1335606-lostvd003.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">and he resting in the middle of a bamboo forest with a glass of Alcohol in his hand (Identical to the opening scene in the pilot). Along the way to the beach he finds Vincent and a woman's shoe, both from the Pilot, along with a dead body hanging from the vines (From season two \"The Other 48 Days\"). He sees apparitions of Lisa, specifically on the Beach, which is identical to Jack seeing his Father in \"White Rabbit\". One may argue that his ambush at the end of Episode Two, and the sabotage of the Laptop, is similar to Sayid's ambush by Locke which happened near the same time. Also, Elliot is locked up in the armory much like Ben Linus was (Though not beaten to a pulp).<\/p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation<\/h2><p style=\"\">Lost: Via Domus requires 4.2GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/5569\/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5569\/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/5569\/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5569\/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/5569\/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/5569\/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/5569\/192105-lostviadomuscover.jpg"},"name":"Lost: Via Domus"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">As the first game in the popular <a href=\"\/ace-attorney\/3025-907\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-907\">Ace Attorney series<\/a>, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney follows the adventures of <a href=\"\/phoenix-wright\/3005-707\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-707\">Phoenix Wright<\/a>, a young defense attorney who must find his way to becoming a great lawyer by following the lead of his mentor Mia Fey.<\/p><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS<\/a> version of the game is a remake of a 2001 <a href=\"\/game-boy-advance\/3045-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">GBA<\/a> game that was never released outside of Japan, but is updated with touch screen controls, microphone support and a new never-before-seen fifth chapter called \"Rise From the Ashes\".<\/p><p style=\"\">The fictional courtroom proceedings presented in the game, in many ways, parodies the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.escapistmagazine.com\/articles\/view\/issues\/issue_253\/7530-Phoenix-Wrights-Objection\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Japanese civil law system<\/a>, which is known for having a very high prosecution rate.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8888\/199921-mia.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-199921\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8888\/199921-mia.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-199921\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8888\/199921-mia.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Mia Fey<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The plot of Ace Attorney presents <a href=\"\/phoenix-wright\/3005-707\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-707\">Phoenix Wright<\/a>, a rookie defense attorney as he takes on his first few cases under his mentor, <a href=\"\/mia-fey\/3005-1652\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1652\">Mia Fey<\/a>.

However with Maya being only a trainee in this profession, she is still not very good in controlling this ability and as a result always call upon the person she wants to at the right moment. After this case, Maya decides to call Phoenix 'Nick ', as his name is too long in her opinion.<\/p><p style=\"\">Phoenix\u2019s main rival is <a href=\"\/miles-edgeworth\/3005-1491\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1491\">Miles Edgeworth<\/a>, a prosecutor who will stop at nothing to gain a conviction, even if it means telling witnesses to \"not mention\" information pertinent to the case.

The case wraps up very simply, as Phoenix uses logic and copious amounts of help from Mia to prove that Frank was actually just a thief, who'd been trying to steal from Cindy Stone when she walked in. In a fit, he grabbed the closest thing at hand, a statue of The Thinker, and struck her with it. He had just seen Larry leave her house a few minutes before, so Larry became the perfect scapegoat. His first case under his belt, Phoenix sets off in hopes of a brighter future.<\/p><h3>Turnabout Sisters<\/h3><p style=\"\">In this case, Phoenix loses his friend and mentor, Mia Fey and it is up to him to defend her sister Maya in the trial for Mia's murder. It also is the first case to bring up the DL-6 incident, and Misty Fey, which are both important parts of later cases. This case features the first appearance of Miles Edgeworth as the prosecutor.<\/p><p style=\"\">This case is much more difficult than the first, and the stakes are much higher. It introduces the main plot of the game, the DL-6 incident, in which <a href=\"\/misty-fey\/3005-9827\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9827\">Misty Fey<\/a>, Maya and Mia's mother, was called upon to do a summoning to help the police with a murder case. The man she fingered during the channeling, however, was proved to be innocent, and the police kept the details secret. <a href=\"\/redd-white\/3005-9824\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9824\">Redd White<\/a>, however, found out about the summons and exposed the information to the press, making Misty a laughing stock- she went in to hiding, leaving Mia and Maya without a mother. Mia quickly left training for being a spirit medium and turned to the law, hoping to exact justice on the man who destroyed her mother.<\/p><p style=\"\">And she had been close. She had many important files, hidden inside a Thinker statue (which was, once more, the murder weapon), and White found out by having his assistant, <a href=\"\/april-may\/3005-9823\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9823\">April May<\/a>, wire-tap Mia's phone. White didn't care if she was caught, though, as he considered himself above the law. He even had Mia's mentor, <a href=\"\/marvin-grossberg\/3005-9825\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9825\">Marvin Grossberg<\/a>, in his pocket, evidenced through Grossberg's unwillingness to help you out, and the disappearance of his gigantic painting later in the case (that reappears in White's office).<\/p><p style=\"\">White, it turns out, wasn't just blackmailing Grossberg into doing his bidding. It seemed as though the only goal of his company was blackmailing others with the dirt he dug up on them, going so far as to cause people to commit suicide. It was no wonder he had to kill Mia, who was so close to discovering his secrets. With one fell stroke, he tore the family apart, leaving just Maya with you. White is put behind bars for good at the end of this, with April May serving time for aiding him.<\/p><h3>Turnabout Samurai<\/h3><p style=\"\">A TV celebrity; <a href=\"\/jack-hammer\/3005-9829\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9829\">Jack Hammer<\/a>, is murdered.

Maya suggests the case to Phoenix because she is a huge fan of the TV show. Miles Edgeworth is the prosecutor in this case.<\/p><p style=\"\">Turnabout Samurai takes a break from the main story to tell a different, insular one. As the Evil Magistrate lies dead in the Global Studios lot, Maya calls you and tells you you're going to defend Powers, a bear of a man who's actually a real softy. It's immediately apparent that he wouldn't hurt anyone. He's just a stuntman in a good role, and he's been framed.<\/p><p style=\"\">Heading out to Global results in nothing but a headache since it means overcoming the famed <a href=\"\/wendy-oldbag\/3005-15344\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15344\">Wendy Oldbag<\/a>, working security detail, and catching Cody Hackins, a little kid who likes to break in because he really worships the Steel Samurai. The only real information you get is that Powers was hurt during practice, and the weapon was the Steel Samurai's spear. Everything looks bad from the start- only Powers had an alibi that wasn't easily provable, and there was also the matter of The Steel Samurai being caught on camera. After a while, though, Phoenix notices that the Steel Samurai on the camera is too short and limping on the wrong leg, thus proving it wasn't Powers in the picture. Phoenix even later uncovers a bottle of sleeping pills, and finds out that there were two more people in the studio that day, <a href=\"\/dee-vasquez\/3005-16471\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16471\">Dee Vasquez<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sal-manella\/3005-16470\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16470\">Sal Manella<\/a>, two of the higher ups at the studio. They're less than cooperative, saying they had been trapped at a different part of the studio until 3, which doesn't line up with the murder time of Hammer, which was around 2:30.<\/p><p style=\"\">Phoenix unearthed a photo during the investigation, however, that showed Hammer and another man at the second lot of Global Studios. Hammer, during a scene, had accidentally pushed the man back and he fell onto a sharp fence post, which pierced his heart and killed him instantly. Vasquez used this to blackmail Hammer, keeping him from the stardom he could have achieved and making him do only children's shows for nearly 5 years. Hammer had had enough, though, and it was he who decided to do murder on the day of the crime- the murder of Dee Vasquez. He dressed in Powers' Steel Samurai costume so he could frame Powers, and ventured over to studio 2, where Vasquez had been.<\/p><p style=\"\">They say fate is not without a sense of irony, and as Hammer leapt towards Vasquez, murder on his mind, he missed. He fell. He was stabbed in the heart by a sharp fencepost. Determined to keep herself from getting in any kind of trouble for this, Vasquez ordered Manella to help her. They redressed the body, hid it in a van that was nearby and then, when they could, drove it over to Studio 1 and left it, once more framing Powers for the murder.<\/p><p style=\"\">Powers is shocked that Hammer would try to frame him, and sighs as he realizes that the Steel Samurai can't go on without Hammer, who played the evil character. All is not lost, though, for at the moment that Manella had laid eyes on Maya, he came up with his next story- The Pink Princess!! Powers gladly accepted this new role, and Maya's fandom shifted from Steel to Pink. Looks like everything turned out OK.<\/p><h3>Turnabout Goodbyes<\/h3><p style=\"\">Miles Edgeworth is suspected of shooting a man and it is up to Phoenix Wright to defend his rival, in a seemingly impossible case.<\/p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/manfred-von-karma\/3005-2403\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2403\">Manfred Von Karma<\/a> makes his debut as prosecutor in this case.<\/p><p style=\"\">This case ties the DL-6 story thread back in and puts a bow on it. At the beginning of the story, Edgeworth is shown, his hands on a gun in the middle of a lake. <a href=\"\/lotta-hart\/3005-9990\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9990\">Lotta Hart<\/a>, a photographer, was camping nearby and had a sound- sensitive camera hooked up. As soon as it sounded, it took a series of photos, capturing the moment of the crime. This, along with the police testimony of a nearby boatkeeper that Edgeworth passed by, muttering to himself about the murder, was enough to convict him of killing Robert Hammond, the defense attorney in the DL-6 case.<\/p><p style=\"\">What's worse is that Edgeworth would have had a motive. It was Edgeworth's father who died in the DL-6 Incident, and it was Hammond who got the man the police blamed a \"not guilty\" so many years ago. That this happened on the anniversary of the incident merely made it poetic. It was an open and close case, and von Karma was certain it would take mere minutes.<\/p><p style=\"\">Leave it to Phoenix to drag it out to the logical conclusion that none of the evidence or circumstances were good enough to put Edgeworth as the murderer, especially since the hand used to fire the gun in Lotta's picture wasn't the same as the fingerprints on the gun. Using this to buy time, Phoenix finds the boat shop keeper, a rather confused old man, and brings him in as a witness... but he won't testify. Or even act like he knows where he is, forcing Phoenix to attempt one of the game's more memorable cross examinations: calling the boat-keeper's parrot to the stand. The gamble works, and it's eventually determined that the old man is Yanni Yogi, the defendant in the DL-6 incident, and that this whole course of events has played out not for Edgeworth's revenge, but for his own.<\/p><p style=\"\">Yanni actually WAS innocent of the DL-6 incident. However, the press around the case was so bad that, though he was acquitted, he could never shake the people calling him a murderer everywhere he went. He decided to exact revenge on the man who ruined his life and take Edgeworth down with him, as it had been his father who was murdered and caused the case in the first place. Yanni admits to the murder, but there's one thing Phoenix wishes to tie up still.<\/p><p style=\"\">The DL-6 incident was never solved, and if Yanni wasn't the murderer, the circumstances meant that only Edgeworth or Edgeworth's father could have been the one who killed. What happened was that Yanni, Edgeworth Sr. and Miles Edgeworth were riding in an elevator together when an earthquake struck that left them stranded, and the air was running out. Yanni began to lose it, berating the father and son for stealing his air, and threw himself at Gregory Edgeworth. Miles picked up the closest thing to him, Yanni's gun (which had fallen out of the holster in their struggle), and threw it. A gunshot rang out, and everyone passed out from lack of oxygen. When they were roused, Gregory was dead, and it could only have been Edgeworth.<\/p><p style=\"\">Edgeworth has had a crippling phobia of earthquakes ever since.<\/p><p style=\"\">Until Phoenix notices that the gun had actually fired twice. Where was the second bullet? Close inspection of the evidence revealed a bullet hole through the glass on the elevator, though no bullet had been found before. All that anyone remembered was a blood-curdling scream after the gunshot. If it hadn't been Edgeworth's dad, though, then who was it?<\/p><p style=\"\">Gregory Edgeworth was actually a defense attorney, who Miles was looking to emulate later in life until this incident. It wasn't the shame of losing his dad, but the pain of the defense attorney Hammond getting Yogi off on all charges. Gregory had been doing more than just criminal defense. He'd been researching into corruption, falsified evidence and witnesses being told to withhold information, and he'd been getting pretty close to hitting an end point. And this was a thorn in the side of the prosecutors, specifically the highest profile one: Manfred von Karma. When the gun went off, it hit him in the arm, and he walked over to the elevator, and saw a golden opportunity- his single greatest threat, passed out on the floor, a gun lying next to him. Seizing his chance, he pulled the trigger, and it was all over. A pass of a metal detector revealed that the bullet was still in von Karma. Edgeworth was then cleared of murder in all accounts, von Karma taking the fall he'd dodged for so long.<\/p><p style=\"\">Maya comes to you at the end of the case with tears in her eyes, telling you she'd been useless. Earlier, though, von Karma had run into you in an evidence room. He tasers Phoenix and steals his evidence, but Maya holds on to a bullet- a bullet that wound up saving the case. No matter what you do for her, though, she leaves to start training in Kurain Village again. Maya gone, Phoenix looks back on his first year as an attorney, and looks forward to more in the future.<\/p><h3>The Classroom Case<\/h3><p style=\"\">Turnabout Goodbyes delves very far into the past, for both Edgeworth and, later, Phoenix. While the origin of Edgeworth as a prosecutor is part of the main story point, Phoenix is mentioned later as a flashback, explaining a time when he was at a new school and someone's lunch money had disappeared. Phoenix couldn't turn to anyone, and they all thought it was him who had stolen the money, until a small boy with a cravat shouted \"OBJECTION!\" Miles Edgeworth flew to his feet to defend Phoenix, stating that the evidence just wasn't there. Larry Butz piped up from another corner of the room, defending Phoenix as well. Of course, it was Larry who had stolen it, but he had a good alibi, so no one thought it was him. He couldn't let another kid take the fall, though, so he interjected, and from that day forth, Phoenix was to be a defense attorney, as he would always remember how helpless he felt until someone came to defend him. He wanted to be able to pass that feeling along.<\/p><h3>Rise From The Ashes<\/h3><p style=\"\">This case was exclusive to the DS version of Ace Attorney and featured touch screen controls for some of the investigation techniques.<\/p><p style=\"\">Phoenix must defend <a href=\"\/lana-skye\/3005-8813\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8813\">Lana Skye<\/a> for the murder of Detective Bruce Goodman. In this case, Lana's sister <a href=\"\/ema-skye\/3005-2749\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2749\">Ema<\/a> becomes Phoenix's assistant, due to Maya being away for her spiritual training. Ema is a young scientist who is intelligent beyond her years.<\/p><p style=\"\">Rise From The Ashes is the longest case in the Phoenix Wright games, and one of the most complicated. It starts with the murder of one Bruce Goodman, a detective, by Lana Skye, the Chief Prosecutor, in the parking garage of the Prosecutor's Office. She stabbed him with Edgeworth's knife, in Edgeworth's call, and immediately rattled off a phone call when she was done to her sister, Ema, and the only word that could be remembered was 'tailpipe'. There was even a photo, from <a href=\"\/angel-starr\/3005-16236\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16236\">Angel Starr<\/a> (the star witness, lololol), a former detective herself who now dates multiple people at once and sells box lunches. All of this precludes one final fact: Lana is choosing not to fight and is pleading guilty. Phoenix will have none of this, though, and investigates the case anyways, eventually finding a few things, specifically in the tail pipe, pointing to a case called the \"SL-9 Incident\".<\/p><p style=\"\">SL-9 was a case from many years ago that revolved around a serial killer named Joe Darke. Goodman, it turns out, was involved with the case. So was Starr, and Neil and <a href=\"\/jake-marshall\/3005-16234\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16234\">Jake Marshall<\/a>. The case ended with Darke in custody, but he escaped and ran into the office of the Chief Prosecutor, who was, at that time, Damon Gant. The only person in there was Ema, and he charged her, only to be apprehended by Neil. Neil and Darke fought, but the power went out and, in a flash of lightning, Ema saw Neil on the floor, Darke about to stab him, and lashed out, pushing them away and knocking Darke out, only after he managed to kill Neil. Darke was sentenced to death, but something didn't gel right to the detectives... there was evidence they found that was missing, and evidence that none of them remembered existing, used in the case. Even after it was put away, they wanted to investigate still further, and Starr alluded to that case in some way tying to the current one.<\/p><p style=\"\">Things take a further unexpected turn when <a href=\"\/damon-gant\/3005-16212\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16212\">Damon Gant<\/a>, now Chief of Police, shows up during the hearing. He then mentions a second murder that the police are looking in to, in which someone was murdered in the evidence room. Using the clues in front of him, though, Phoenix determines that it was actually Goodman who had been murdered there, as well, and perhaps then transported over to the prosecutor's building.<\/p><p style=\"\">Someone, it seems, had been trying to steal from Goodman's evidence locker, Phoenix hypothesizes. It's a finger scanner that opens the locker, but a glove had blocked the door from closing fully, according to video evidence, proving that it couldn't have been Goodman because he wouldn't have needed that otherwise. Jake Marshall is then revealed to have dressed as Goodman so he could take evidence to look further into the case, as he never felt Neil was fully avenged. This, however, proves that Goodman wasn't killed in the Evidence Room, and Phoenix is once more in trouble, as this proves Lana must have killed him. A list of people who had entered the evidence room is then produced, with one of the codes for entry a secret, reading only as a series of sevens.<\/p><p style=\"\">In an effort to understand what had happened during SL-9, Phoenix and Ema break in to Chief Gant's office, which was split with Lana's straight down the middle. Acting on a hunch, Phoenix breaks into Gant's safe using the series of 7s that was on the evidence room admission list and finds a piece of cloth with a handprint on it and a piece of a jar- a piece that was missing from a jar Phoenix had in evidence, and finally, an evidence list with a drawing on the back of two men, one about to stab the other. Phoenix, the next day, attempts to show who really killed Neil during SL-9, and uses some of this evidence, only to find that... it all pointed to Ema. Gant was also able to produce a photo of Neil impaled on the spear of a suit of armor, blood pulling out of his mouth, saying Ema had pushed him and he accidentally fell to his death like this. Lana said that she had changed the layout of the scene to make it look otherwise, even to the point of burying the tip of a knife into the cut, to prevent Ema from the shock of knowing she killed a man.<\/p><p style=\"\">But something seemed wrong... The spot of leather that had been found in the safe matched with what Neil was wearing, only it had already been cut out in this picture. And how could Ema's name have been written on the jar if it had been broken? It would be impossible to write along the cracks like that. This shows that someone had been to the room before Lana had been, and it was them who had cut the leather and written her name! And there was only one person this could have been: Chief Gant. It was in his locker this evidence was found, so it seemed apparent at first that he had cut out the leather with Ema's handprint and had written Ema's name on the vase himself so that he could have something to hold over the head of Lana, so that while he was Chief of Police, he was still, essentially, in control of the prosecutor's office. Pointing out an inconsistency with the blood stain, though, Phoenix hit on a deeper truth.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gant had killed Neil. Gant had come into the room, killed Neil himself by putting him on the suit of armor's spear, and then ordered Lana to change the way the crime was laid out, thus starting her subservience to him that would last many years, culminating in this case.<\/p><p style=\"\">It had been evidence cleaning day in the police HQ. Any cases that were too old to reopen had their evidence disposed of, and Gant went in with Goodman since Goodman had lost his ID. Goodman then appealed for SL-9 to be reopened, and Gant panicked, lashing out and killing Goodman. He then called Lana, who he had load the body into Edgeworth's car and they cleaned up the evidence room as best they could. Later, Gant called Edgeworth and asked for something to be brought to him, and Edgeworth only happily obliged, not realizing that he was transporting a body.<\/p><p style=\"\">Gant almost seems amiable when he admits defeat.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the end, Ema goes off to school to become a scientific investigator, her bond with her sister renewed, and her sister serving minimal time for aiding Gant in his nefarious schemes. The case not only destroyed 2 of the most powerful law enforcers in the district, but also cast severe shadows over the Prosecutor's office, about nefarious acts, covering and falsifying evidence, but it seems like it's going to be ok. Edgeworth has nothing to worry about and Phoenix, now without a partner, sits back for the next case.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Ace Attorney\u2019s gameplay is split into two sections: investigation and trial.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once Phoenix accepts a case, he must go to the crime scene and try and work out what really happened. This involves using the touch screen to examine an area, looking for important items, interviewing witnesses via a series of questions and presenting collected evidence, and check collected pieces of evidence for more clues. Everything can be controlled using the standard buttons as well as the touch screen for the Nintendo DS version. Once enough evidence and witness statements have been collected, the game moves into the second section, the trial.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/259\/234260-court_room1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234260\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/259\/234260-court_room1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234260\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/259\/234260-court_room1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Court Room<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The trial is controlled in exactly the same way as the investigation, but is focused on picking holes in witness statements and presenting evidence to the judge to prove your theories on what really happened. As each witness statement is presented, you can press each statement made to push a little harder and clarify the information. Sometimes, this will lead to new statements being added, or allow you to present contradicting evidence against the statement in the form of an objection. In the Nintendo DS version, you can also object by shouting \"Objection!\" into the microphone. If you present the wrong evidence, however, the judge will penalize you. Once you are penalized five times, it is game over and the game resumes to the title screen where users can choose to start from the beginning or resume from the last save point.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the Nintendo DS version of the game, a fifth case has been added to the game, and a new mechanic is introduced which allows some pieces of evidence to be manipulated in 3D using the touch screen, so they can reveal more secrets. You can also dust the evidence down with fingerprint powder and blow into the microphone to reveal the print.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p style=\"\">The music of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney can be found on the double disc \"<i>Gyakut<\/i><i>en Saiban 1 2 Original Soundtrack<\/i>\", composed by Sugimoi Masakazu and Akemi Kimura.

It supports up to four players offline, up to eight online on the console versions, and six on the Nintendo DS version. The PC version is not online-enabled.<\/p><p style=\"\">In 2011, Sega produced an arcade version of the title, featuring only 13 playable characters and 13 tracks. Game modes include Grand Prix, Single Races and Time Trials. Up to eight cabinets can be linked together for multiplayer modes. Optional kits can be added onto cabinets for ticket redemption for at least 5 tickets for players finishing first in races multiplied by human players who are playing the game.

Each track is laid out with various sharp turns, jumps, and <a href=\"\/shortcut\/3015-3171\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3171\">shortcuts<\/a>. When taking on a sharp turn, the player may drift by pressing and holding the <a href=\"\/drifting\/3015-74\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-74\">Drift<\/a> button as they turn. While holding the Drift button, the player may also rapidly press the Accelerate button to make their turn even sharper. As the player drifts, they will build up a turbo-boost which will give the player a small burst of speed when they let go of the Drift button. The longer the player drifts, the longer the boost will be, with there being three levels of turbo-<a href=\"\/boost\/3015-461\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-461\">boost<\/a>. If you bump into anything while drifting, you will lose any turbo-boost accumulated from that drift. Pressing the Drift button in mid-air after launching from a jump will have your character perform a <a href=\"\/tricks\/3015-1913\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1913\">trick<\/a> from their kart. Successfully finishing the trick will result in a turbo-boost upon landing. Much like drifting, you may perform up three tricks to build up to three levels of turbo-boost, with each character having different tricks, some will be able to perform theirs faster than others, with those who have longer tricks are given longer boosts as opposed to those with shorter tricks. If the player lands in the middle of performing a trick, no turbo-boost is given, though they retain the speed they were driving at.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83448\/1378282-nights_sonic_and_sega_all_star_racing_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1378282\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83448\/1378282-nights_sonic_and_sega_all_star_racing_screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1378282\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/83448\/1378282-nights_sonic_and_sega_all_star_racing_screenshot.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>NiGHTS as the referee of the game, waving the checkered flag to start and end the race.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Also strewn about the track are a multitude of <a href=\"\/item-container\/3015-3401\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3401\">item bubbles<\/a>, <a href=\"\/boost-pad\/3055-2118\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2118\">turbo pads<\/a>, and obstacles, all for the racers to use to their advantage. Item bubbles give the racer one of 11 random items to use from. Depending on what place you're in will also alter the odds of which item you will receive. For example, a racer in seventh place is more likely to receive a <a href=\"\/rocket\/3055-713\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-713\">Giant Rocket<\/a> or an All-Star, while a racer in first place is more likely to receive a <a href=\"\/anti-personnel-mine\/3055-1412\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1412\">Mine<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/boxing-glove\/3055-213\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-213\">K.O.

Players control Francis York Morgan (or other characters in certain chapters) as they navigate around town, searching for clues. Moving the left stick controls the player's movement while moving the right stick controls the camera. (In rare occasions, the camera is fixed in a particular location) Holding down the X button causes York to move faster (slowly filling up his Pulse Gauge in the process). Holding down the X button and pressing down on the left stick causes York to perform a quick 180-degree turn. Holding down the left or right bumpers cause York to strafe left or right. Pressing the Y button toggles York's flashlight (though he doesn't seem to be physically carrying any flashlights).<\/p><p style=\"\">Certain objects and items can be interacted with (using the A button) or observed (using the B button). Observing objects often gives a text dialog indicating what it does (though sometimes it's necessary to proceed through the game). Interacting allows York to pick up items (if he has enough space in his inventory), go through doors (which can be opened faster by running while interacting), push boxes and use objects. Items can also be automatically placed into York's Toolbox by pressing the Y button.<\/p><h3>Hunger, Fatigue, and Hygiene<\/h3><p style=\"\">Deadly Premonition utilizes <a href=\"\/hunger\/3015-677\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-677\">hunger<\/a> management and <a href=\"\/fatigue\/3015-5975\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5975\">fatigue<\/a> management systems. Along with Health and Pulse gauges, York also has a Hunger Gauge and a Sleep Gauge, which both slowly depletes over time. If the Sleep Gauge is fully depleted, the Hunger Gauge depletes quicker. If the Hunger Gauge is fully depleted, the Health Gauge starts depleting. Eating food items such as <a href=\"\/lollipop\/3055-639\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-639\">lollipops<\/a> and cans of <a href=\"\/pickle\/3055-3527\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3527\">pickles<\/a> restores some of the Hunger Gauge, as well as eating at certain establishments in Greenvale. Drinking <a href=\"\/coffee\/3055-2716\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2716\">coffee<\/a> or <a href=\"\/root-beer\/3055-721\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-721\">root beer<\/a> restores some of the Sleep Gauge, as well as <a href=\"\/sleeping\/3015-1538\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1538\">sleeping<\/a> in beds. (which also restores the Health Gauge and advances the time)<\/p><p style=\"\">Along from managing hunger and tiredness, the game also has a hygiene management system. Hygiene isn't indicated by a gauge or a meter. Instead, it's indicated on York's character model. Opting not to <a href=\"\/shaving\/3015-4750\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4750\">shave<\/a> results in York growing an awesome beard (with no negative effects), while not sending clothes to the dry cleaners causes flies to gather around a smelly York (hindering bonuses that appear during normal gameplay). York starts with three suits, which can be changed and sent to the dry cleaners by interacting with <a href=\"\/briefcase\/3055-72\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-72\">suitcases<\/a>. He can also find other suits by completing side quests, with some suits also giving bonuses (for example, wearing the Passion Red suit boosts York's maximum health).<\/p><h3>Driving<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17172\/1418653-dp_driving33.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1418653\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17172\/1418653-dp_driving33.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1418653\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/17172\/1418653-dp_driving33.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Driving plays a huge role in Deadly Premonition.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Navigation and exploration of <a href=\"\/greenvale\/3035-2810\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2810\">Greenvale<\/a> (the game is open world) involves driving cars. Early in the game, York obtains a \"Master Key\" item, which can be used to operate <a href=\"\/police-car\/3055-844\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-844\">police cars<\/a>. Later in the game, York can purchase faster, better-handling cars from the Greenvale Scrap Yard (including York's own car, which must be repaired). Each type of car has different speed, brake power, handling, and power. Driving different cars also plays different piece of music, while driving some cars give bonuses to York (such as York's car, which regenerates his health).<\/p><p style=\"\">Holding down the right trigger accelerates the car, while holding down the left trigger activates the car's brakes (when the car is moving forward) or accelerates the car in reverse. Holding down the B button activates the handbrake (for quick turns). Holding down the X button activates the sirens (only on police cars) while boosting the car's acceleration and top speed. However, using the sirens slowly fills up York's stamina bar. Pressing either bumpers change the camera angle to one of three angles (including a <a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person perspective<\/a> of York). Pressing the A button while stopped causes York to exit the vehicle, while pressing the A button while driving (at certain times) causes York to talk to the other passengers (or Zach). The D-Pad is used to toggle <a href=\"\/windshield-wipers\/3055-3613\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3613\">windshield wipers<\/a> and turn signals, pressing the Y button toggles headlights, and pressing the left stick activates the horn.<\/p><p style=\"\">While driving, Gas and Endurance meters show up on the bottom-right corner of the screen. The Gas Meter slowly depletes as York drives, and can be replenished by driving to a <a href=\"\/gas-station\/3035-1917\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1917\">gas station<\/a> . If the Gas Meter is fully depleted, the car will stop functioning. The Endurance Meter depletes as York bumps his vehicle into other cars, walls, and obstacles, and can be replenished by driving to the gas station and letting <a href=\"\/gina-the-rose\/3005-15103\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15103\">Gina the Rose<\/a> (or her husband <a href=\"\/jack-the-raging-bull\/3005-15104\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15104\">Jack the Raging Bull<\/a>) wash the car. If that meter is fully depleted, the car will catch on fire. Failure to exit the car quickly causes the car to explode, killing York.<\/p><h3>Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\">During certain parts of the game, York finds himself in places affected by the \"Other World\", an unexplained phenomenon (that only York sees) in which dangerous supernatural enemies exist. In these places, the atmosphere turns dark and grungy (often times including a rainstorm), and the player will be attacked by Shadows (corpses \"possessed\" by evil spirits, which cannot see but can hear human breathing).<\/p><p style=\"\">York must enter these areas in specific parts of the story to progress, but the outdoors of Greenvale are also infected by the \"Other World\" between midnight and 6:00 A.M. In the latter scenario, York will also be attacked by ethereal birds and giant dogs. York can temporarily hide in dumpsters at this time to escape the beings (in which the Pulse Gauge rises, forcing York to abandon the dumpster when the gauge reaches maximum).<\/p><p style=\"\">York has a variety of weapons to deal with Shadows, including ranged weaponry (ranging from <a href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistols<\/a> to <a href=\"\/rocket-launcher\/3055-211\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launchers<\/a>) and melee weaponry (ranging from <a href=\"\/knife\/3055-295\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-295\">knives<\/a> to <a href=\"\/katana\/3055-690\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-690\">katanas<\/a>). Ranged weapons have finite ammunition (and must be reloaded) while melee weapons have finite <a href=\"\/durability\/3015-2549\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2549\">durability<\/a> (and must be discarded after it breaks). Pistols have unlimited ammo, and players can find other weapons with <a href=\"\/infinite-ammo\/3015-1599\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1599\">infinite ammo<\/a> or infinite duration by completing certain side-quests.<\/p><p style=\"\">The traditional Shadows move slowly towards York (sometimes warping around to mess with his aim), sometimes in freaky stances, and either attacks with their current weapon or by grabbing York in a freakish way (both ways draining his health).<\/p><h3>Profiling<\/h3><p style=\"\">When investigating crime scenes or suspicious areas, York will come across clues and evidence tying the setting and recent events that occur there; the actual profiling is a series of non-interactive slideshows that are partially blocked out by white noise. Each profiling section consists of a set number of clues and are represented by key icons on the screen. After each clue is retrieved, players have the option to profile the crime scene again for bonus points, and each round of profiling removes more of the slideshow's white noise.<\/p><h3>Side Missions<\/h3><p style=\"\">Throughout the game, players can partake in the game's fifty side missions ranging from beating a high score in a darts to driving an old lady home. Upon completion of a side mission or a set of related side missions, the player is rewarded with items such as trading cards. However, some of the more intensive tasks offer greater rewards. For example, finding an unnamed flower for George Woodman will grant access to the Radio, a device used for <a href=\"\/fast-travel\/3015-676\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-676\">fast travel<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Cars<\/h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Car Name<\/th><th>Speed<\/th><th>Brake<\/th><th>Handling<\/th><th>Power<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Machina<\/b> (Carol's car)<\/td><td>Fast<\/td><td>Weak<\/td><td>Difficult<\/td><td>Low<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Jogcargo<\/b> (Lilly's car)<\/td><td>Slow<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Easy<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>SR Sportwagon<\/b> (Nick's car)<\/td><td>Slow<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Easy<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Wave R2000<\/b> (Quint's car)<\/td><td>Fast<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Difficult<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>S33 Conder<\/b> (Richard's car)<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Strong<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Carmen GT<\/b> (Diane's car)<\/td><td>Slow<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Easy<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>AppleStar<\/b> (Thomas' car)<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Strong<\/td><td>Easy<\/td><td>Low<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Mezger C600<\/b> (Ushah's car)<\/td><td>Fast<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Woodland<\/b> (Kaysen's truck)<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Strong<\/td><td>Difficult<\/td><td>Low<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Rockabilly 58'<\/b> (Keith's car)<\/td><td>Fast<\/td><td>Weak<\/td><td>Medium<\/td><td>Low<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Tough Chap<\/b> (Emily's car)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Elephant T-3<\/b> (George's car)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>York's Car<\/b> (with unlimited gas)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Main Characters<\/h2><h3><a href=\"\/francis-york-morgan\/3005-14246\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14246\">Special Agent Francis York Morgan<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5809\/1291767-agent_morgan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1291767\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5809\/1291767-agent_morgan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1291767\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5809\/1291767-agent_morgan.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Agent Francis York Morgan, on his way to Greenvale.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">A peculiar FBI agent who specializes in profiling serial killers based on minor clues. Prefers to go by his middle name. Slightly crazy and nonsensical, he often refers to and consults a mysterious entity named \"Zach\" by verbally expressing his inner monologue. He smokes and hardly flinches during uncanny situations. He often references old pop culture; for example, he has a conversation about <a href=\"\/tom-and-jerry\/3025-268\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-268\">Tom &amp; Jerry<\/a> during the prologue. He acquired some of the scars on his face on his assignment prior to the Greenvale murder, in which he apprehended a <a href=\"\/catwoman\/3005-654\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-654\">Catwoman<\/a> wannabe who laced razor blades along her fingernails.

The main story starts off in a dream sequence, in which York (everyone calls him that) finds himself in an outdoor area filled with trees, red leaves, living room accouterments and angelic analogs of <a href=\"\/isaach-ingram\/3005-14653\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14653\">Isaach<\/a> and <a href=\"\/isaiah-ingram\/3005-14654\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14654\">Isaiah<\/a>, the twins that discovered the dead body. The mysterious scene quickly shifts to York driving to Greenvale, having a conversation about the psychological profiles of Tom and Jerry with his imaginary friend, Zach, with whom he constantly discusses his situation, <i>sotto voce<\/i>, in order to not be overheard by nearby people. On his way into town, he nearly runs over a person and gets into a car accident that lands him in the thick of a <a href=\"\/forest\/3035-1889\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1889\">forest<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">He begins making his way to Greenvale on foot and runs into numerous zombie-like creatures identified as \"mysterious shadows\", whose existence is never explained or even confirmed. Also, York has a brief encounter with <a href=\"\/the-raincoat-killer\/3005-14292\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14292\">an axe-wielding man in a raincoat<\/a>, but manages to escape and finds his way out of the forest. On the way into town, he runs into Deputy Sheriff <a href=\"\/emily-wyatt\/3005-14283\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14283\">Emily Wyatt<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sheriff\/3015-4807\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4807\">Sheriff<\/a> <a href=\"\/george-woodman\/3005-14284\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14284\">George Woodman<\/a> on the town's outskirts. George, with a loathing for \"corrupt\" city officers, is reluctant to let York (who he refuses to call that) anywhere near the case.<\/p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 01: First day of investigation<\/h3><p style=\"\">The first episode starts off in another dream sequence, in which York finds himself in the same outdoor living room as before. This time, however, one of the doors leading outside is open and he has a brief encounter with a child. Here, he runs into a lone mysterious shadow and learns that holding his breath will prevent the monsters from seeing him. After avoiding the shadow, he asks the child who he is but immediately wakes up in the local Greenvale hotel. He ponders over the dream but shrugs it off to get some <a href=\"\/coffee\/3055-2716\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2716\">coffee<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the <a href=\"\/cafeteria\/3035-2568\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2568\">cafeteria<\/a>, he runs into <a href=\"\/polly-oxford\/3005-14341\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14341\">Polly Oxford<\/a>, the owner of the Great Deer Yard <a href=\"\/hotels\/3035-1998\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1998\">Hotel<\/a>, and the two engage in conversation about Greenvale, the hotel and its history. York believes he can divine hints about the future from the swirling shapes created when he adds milk to his coffee. Today, he sees the letters \"FK\". After pondering the meaning of FK, he makes his way to the <a href=\"\/greenvale-sheriffs-department\/3035-2917\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2917\">police station<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 02: Sheriff office<\/h3><p style=\"\">Upon leaving the hotel, York finds a <a href=\"\/police-car\/3055-844\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-844\">police car<\/a> parked outside with a note and a master key for all the town's police cars. Inside the Sheriff's office, he runs into the soft-spoken and effeminate <a href=\"\/thomas-maclaine\/3005-14338\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14338\">Thomas MacLaine<\/a>, the Sheriff's Assistant. After retrieving the lost data storage key, Emily, York and Thomas peruse the victim <a href=\"\/anna-graham\/3005-14600\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14600\">Anna Graham<\/a>'s case file. York, more intrigued by the taste of Thomas' homemade biscuits, is then asked to accompany George and Emily to visit the <a href=\"\/greenvale-hospital\/3035-2918\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2918\">Greenvale General Hospital<\/a> and analyze Anna's autopsy results.<\/p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 03: Autopsy report<\/h3><p style=\"\">At the Greenvale General Hospital, they meet the receptionist, <a href=\"\/freckly-fiona\/3005-14602\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14602\">Freckly Fiona<\/a>, and are told to meet <a href=\"\/ushah-johnson\/3005-14339\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14339\">Dr. Ushah Johnson<\/a> in the computer room. There, York solves a simple puzzle involving <a href=\"\/chess-pieces\/3055-934\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-934\">chess pieces<\/a> on the computer, giving them a <a href=\"\/keycard\/3055-600\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-600\">keycard<\/a> to the basement. The doctor and Anna's body lay in wait in the morgue, and they begin deducing the events of Anna's murder; the cause of death was from loss of blood by a cut across her abdomen. Additionally, she was gripping something in her right hand at the time of death and her tongue was bitten off by the killer. Upon closer inspection of the mouth, York finds a <a href=\"\/red-seeds\/3055-3899\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3899\">red seed<\/a> embedded deep within. As a result, Anna's murder becomes tied to a series of murders marked by the presence of red seeds, one York has apparently been following personally for some time, and he declares that the investigation now falls under complete FBI jurisdiction.<\/p><p style=\"\">When York leaves the autopsy room to smoke a <a href=\"\/cigarette\/3055-311\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-311\">cigarette<\/a>, the hospital becomes affected by the \"Other World\", the dark and viney realm where the Mysterious Shadows dwell. He begins to see Anna Graham prancing around the halls in a red dress and follows her to the entrance. Some red ivy and three <a href=\"\/shotgun\/3055-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotgun<\/a>-equipped shadows block the way, but he quickly dispatches them, causing the hospital to return to its regular state just as George and Emily enter the room. As they leave, <a href=\"\/harry-stewart\/3005-14337\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14337\">Harry Stewart<\/a>, an eccentric wheelchair-bound millionaire who constantly wears a <a href=\"\/gas-mask\/3055-372\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-372\">gas mask<\/a>, and his assistant, <a href=\"\/michael-tillotson\/3005-14616\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14616\">Michael Tillotson<\/a>, who inexplicably speaks in rhyme, leave York with cryptic warnings regarding the case and leave the hospital. Thomas pages Emily and the three head for the spot where the dead body was discovered.<\/p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 04: Profiling<\/h3><p style=\"\">At the scene, York talks to <a href=\"\/jim-green\/3005-14652\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14652\">Jim Green<\/a>'s two grandsons, Isaach and Isaiah, against the wishes of their grandfather and the two police officers. The twins don't seem fazed by having found Anna's body, not seeming to understand that the mutilated corpse was dead. The boys describe the scene as though they saw a <a href=\"\/fairy\/3015-2721\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2721\">fairy<\/a> or goddess, and that Anna seemed happy. From the clues strewn about the forest, York deduces that Anna's body was used as an object of worship and that there was another person present at the scene of Anna's body; the stiletto heels point to one specific person in the town: <a href=\"\/diane-ames\/3005-14374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14374\">Diane<\/a>, the art gallery owner. Another clue, a small piece of metal, points York to the old lumber mill. Since Diane is out of town on business, they decide to head to the lumber mill first.<\/p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 05: Murder Site<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1713305-deadlypremonitionclownfaces.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1713305\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1713305-deadlypremonitionclownfaces.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1713305\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62890\/1713305-deadlypremonitionclownfaces.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Why so serious?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">York drives to the lumber mill in the rain with Emily and George. He tells them to wait outside since he considers them suspects, much to their dismay. Upon setting foot inside the lumber mill, York informs Zach once again that \"they're here\" and enters the Other World. Inside the lumber mill, York discovers where Anna was murdered, and later has another encounter with the man in the raincoat, evidently the murderer. York remains hidden, only to be chased around the mill with the confrontation ending at an <a href=\"\/elevator\/3055-550\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-550\">elevator<\/a> which York cleverly triggers to separate him and the killer. At no point does he take the opportunity to pull out his gun and shoot the madman.<\/p><p style=\"\">York finds himself back in regular Greenvale and relates his findings to George and Emily. He explains to them that he and Zach determined that Anna was murdered in there by a someone with an inverted peace symbol on their back. He asks George and Emily to show him their backs, and they reluctantly comply. While Emily's back is totally bare, George's back is completely covered in scars -- which he does not wish to discuss. George also tells York the local legend of the Raincoat Killer, a man in a raincoat who supposedly appears on rainy days to murder people. Although the citizens of Greenvale don't really believe in the legend, they still tend to stay indoors on rainy days, to the point where local businesses close if the weather is poor. George himself doesn't believe the story, and quickly dismisses it as nothing more than a fairy tale.<\/p><p style=\"\">The next day, George and Emily gather all of the town's citizens together at the Greenvale Community Center so that York can discuss the murder investigation with them.<\/p><h3>Episode 1, Chapter 06: Greenvale inhabitants<\/h3><p style=\"\">Various citizens in the town gather in the theatre of the community center to discuss the recent murder. Along with the advice to stay away from dark places, York notes that the murderer may be imitating the fictional Raincoat Killer's methods. The townsfolk are for the most part unimpressed with Agent York. At the conclusion of York's lecture, Harry Stewart and Michael Tillotson warn the attending citizens of a \"purple fog\". Also, Stewart invites York to his house to exchange facts about the murder. Stewart drops hints that the case is tied to a single source and George attempts to get the information out of him, but to no avail. York decides to visit Stewart some other time.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the lecture, York takes the opportunity to briefly meet with all the inhabitants of Greenvale he had not yet met. The most notable appearance is by <a href=\"\/carol-maclaine\/3005-15102\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15102\">Carol MacLaine<\/a>, Thomas's sister, who owns the local bar, the bizarrely named \"Galaxy of Terror\". Carol sparks discussion with York over smoking and starts calling the deceased Anna an \"airhead\". After telling Carol the twins' supposition that Anna was a goddess of the forest, she walks off.<\/p><p style=\"\">In a side discussion with Thomas, York asks him if he has a tattoo on his back. Thomas does, but it is a heart with \"Love G\" written in the center, not an inverted peace symbol, thus relieving him of suspicion. Although briefly curious as to who \"G\" is, York dismisses the tattoo as a sign of Thomas' reckless youth in the '80s.<\/p><p style=\"\">Other characters that appear during the meeting include:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/brian-the-insomniac\/3005-15101\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15101\">Brian the Insomniac<\/a>, a strange man who serves as the town's graveyard custodian.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/richard-dunn\/3005-15109\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15109\">Richard Dunn<\/a>, the owner of the only other bar in town, the equally bizarrely-named dart bar, \"SWERY '65\".<\/li><li><a href=\"\/quint-dunn\/3005-15108\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15108\">Quint Dunn<\/a>, Richard's son, a <a href=\"\/swery-65\/3035-2971\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2971\">SWERY '65<\/a> employee and Becky Ame's boyfriend.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/the-general\/3005-15110\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15110\">The General<\/a>, owner of the local scrap yard and a Vietnam War veteran.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/nick-cormack\/3005-15107\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15107\">Nick Cormack<\/a>, owner of the <a href=\"\/ag-diner\/3035-2915\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2915\">A&amp;G Diner<\/a> and Olivia Cormack's husband.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/olivia-cormack\/3005-14748\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14748\">Olivia Cormack<\/a>, A&amp;G Diner employee and Nick Cormack's wife.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/wesley-the-gunsmith\/3005-15111\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15111\">Wesley the Gunsmith<\/a>, owner of the Panda Bear gun store and <a href=\"\/trading-card\/3055-3775\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3775\">trading card<\/a> enthusiast.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/keith-ingram\/3005-15105\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15105\">Keith Ingram<\/a>, owner of the <a href=\"\/milk-barn\/3035-2929\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2929\">Milk Barn<\/a> general store and Lilly Ingram's husband.

The four have a hearty discussion about local minor crimes as well as York's previous cases. Seemingly unaware of the inappropriateness of the anecdote at the current setting, York casually discusses a serial murder case he had solved involving a man who killed women and used their bones as eating utensils or urine cups (which the murderer would later drink beverages out of without cleaning first). Additionally, he briefly mentions a student who raped eight hundred people before getting interrupted by Emily. Thomas begins crying over Anna's absence in the diner and York heads back to the hotel.<\/p><p style=\"\">There, he discusses case specifics with Zach, focusing on the red seed in Anna's mouth, the broken stiletto heel and the round object that left the upside-down peace mark in Anna's hand. Just before going to sleep, York recalled Emily's back and how it made him feel nostalgic and sad, though he's not sure why.<\/p><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, a truck can be seen dropping off a woman in the middle of the rainstorm. Inside the truck is an obese man in overalls and a yellow shirt, as well as a potted sapling with a few red leaves...<\/p><h3>Episode 2 (part 1), Chapter 08: Muses Gallery<\/h3><p style=\"\">Once again, York finds himself in the Red Room with Isaach and Isaiah. They talk about York's coffee habits and Anna suddenly appears with a tray and some coffee. Becky Ames also appears and repeatedly states \"My name is Becky\" despite York's continued questioning. The twins insist that York take a sip of Anna's coffee, and doing so opens a door in the Red Room. On the other side, he finds himself in a white room with the same child from Chapter 02. York suddenly realizes the child is himself at a young age, and vaguely references an event from his past. Awakening from his dream, York concludes that the case is directly related to him and Zach in some way.<\/p><p style=\"\">Immediately after leaving his room, York runs into <a href=\"\/forrest-kaysen\/3005-14749\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14749\">Forrest Kaysen<\/a>, the fat man from the truck. Kaysen is a travelling sapling salesman, who is constantly accompanied by his dog, Willie. Kaysen explains that he's visiting Greenvale on vacation and comes by the hotel every so often for relaxation. He also hands York one of his saplings and asks why an FBI agent is in the small town. Instead of answering, York asks about seeds, causing Kaysen to go on about his particular saplings and how he in particular is the only one who knows how to grow them. As Kaysen walks away, York ties the man to the \"FK\" he saw in his coffee the day before.<\/p><p style=\"\">Over breakfast, York sees \"FK\" in his coffee once more, and heads out to meet Emily and George. Diane recently returned to the art gallery, so the three decide to give her a visit. Again, York wishes to investigate alone and enters the gallery by himself. Inside, he finds a distraught Olivia Cormack looking at the paintings. She explains her visit by stating a fondness for <a href=\"\/tree\/3055-643\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-643\">trees<\/a>. But given the abundance of real trees in town, York decides she's lying about something as she leaves the gallery.<\/p><p style=\"\">York eavesdrops on a conversation between Carol MacLaine and Diane Ames, ending with Carol storming angrily out of the room. Diane and York have a one-on-one chat and, despite suspicion, she has an alibi for the night Anna was killed: she was having a drink with Nick Cormack. Diane openly offers to <a href=\"\/sex\/3015-561\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-561\">sleep with<\/a> York, but he declines the offer and asks no further questions about the case.<\/p><h3>Episode 2 (part 1), Chapter 09: A&amp;G<\/h3><p style=\"\">Outside of the gallery, York glances up towards Diane's office and spots Kaysen and Diane having a discussion. He and Emily decide to visit Nick to corroborate Diane's alibi. Inside the car, the two talk about Kaysen, and Emily mentions that he has a peculiar friendliness with Isaiah and Isaach Ingram. York decides to ask Kaysen about it later and heads to the A&amp;G Diner.<\/p><p style=\"\">The two decide to eat before questioning Nick. Since the check will be paid by the FBI, Emily orders a T-bone <a href=\"\/steak\/3055-3521\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3521\">steak<\/a> while York orders a more conservative <a href=\"\/turkey\/3055-376\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-376\">turkey<\/a> <a href=\"\/sandwich\/3055-1110\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1110\">sandwich<\/a>. Harry and his assistant Michael enter the diner and promptly ask Olivia for Harry's order for a turkey, strawberry jam and cereal sandwich -- Nick's specialty -- is ready. York considers the order a masochistic act, and Harry (through Michael) goads him into trying one. Much to York's surprise, the sandwich tastes <i>amazing<\/i> and he immediately switches his order to one of his own.<\/p><p style=\"\">When York and Emily finally start eating, the two have a heartfelt discussion about their younger days. Emily moved from <a href=\"\/seattle\/3035-517\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-517\">Seattle<\/a> when she was in high school and, due to unfounded gossip that she would sleep with anyone, she doesn't pry into the personal lives of the town's citizens. To empathize, York tells Emily about how he used to be a hardcore punk rocker and how no one would take him seriously because he dressed the part, even though he got good grades. Emily laughs at the thought of York as a punk rocker, and they decide to finally begin questioning Nick about his relationship with Diane.<\/p><p style=\"\">Nick states that he and Diane were merely talking about Rembrandt and Turner the night Anna was killed. Judging by Nick's reaction, York could easily tell he was hiding something from him; Nick says he's busy working and tells York to go away. On the other hand, Olivia says she never goes drinking with Nick and Diane and mentions how she isn't into art. This gives York the opportunity to question her presence at the art gallery and he's told to meet her at the back of the diner one hour after it closes.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the designated time, Olivia mentions how Nick became friendly with Diane and often returns early in the morning. Understandably suspicious that her husband may be cheating on her, she followed him one night and saw that they left the bar for the art gallery. Before Diane entered the gallery, Olivia could have sworn Diane was staring directly at her; the next day, Anna was dead. Her confrontation with York at the gallery was due to her need to see Diane regarding her husband, however she couldn't go through with it. Just then, Emily gets a radio message from Thomas, stating that something is happening at Becky Ames' house and that the Raincoat Killer was mentioned. York leaves Emily to take care of Olivia while he goes to investigate Becky's house.<\/p><h3>Episode 2 (part 1), Chapter 10: The 2nd sacrifice<\/h3><p style=\"\">In the midst of thunderstorm, York makes his way to Becky's house to find Thomas and a hysterical Quint sitting outside. When York asks about what happened, Quint repeatedly moans about Becky and Thomas says he has been like that since arriving on the scene. York enters Becky's house alone, telling Thomas to follow George's orders when he and Emily arrive.<\/p><p style=\"\">Inside, York encounters the Other World once more and begins profiling using new clues. York runs into the Raincoat Killer and, once again, escapes. Soon after, York discovers Becky was killed while she was sleeping and her body was left hanging in the adjacent bathroom. Just after he finds her, George, Thomas, and Emily arrive in the bathroom as well. Surprisingly, Becky was still alive, but, like Anna, her tongue was cut out by the killer. York attempts to get information out of her, but George, wishing to take Becky to the hospital, cuts a wire holding her up. Cutting the wire springs a trap and breaks Becky's neck. In the instant before her death, York has a vision of Anna reaching out to Becky, which is broken when she coughs up red seeds and a key to a safe. All four investigators are thoroughly shaken, and Thomas vo Official Websitemits in Becky's toilet.<\/p><p style=\"\">Behind a painting in Becky's bedroom, a safe containing a sketchbook reveals she was the women wearing stiletto heels at Anna's murder site. Fearing that the killer would catch her if she left the house, she entrusted the broken shoe and a locket to Isaach and Isaiah, and told them to deliver the items to her sister, Diane. Emily is surprised that York is surprised by this information, assuming he already knew that Diane and Becky were sisters.<\/p><h3>Episode 2 (part 2), Chapter 11: Lost child<\/h3><p style=\"\">The chapter opens up with York questioning Keith and Lilly Ingram about Becky, who worked with them at the Milk Barn general store. She stopped showing up to work and Lilly dismissed the absence as shock. To cheer her up, she took the twins to see Becky. They came back from the visit with a small box yet weren't privy to the contents. When asked where the twins were, the Ingrams said they were with Forrest Kaysen at the <a href=\"\/greenvale-forest-park\/3035-2849\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2849\">Greenvale Forest Park<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the park, Emily and York question the twins about their visit to Becky's house, but the two remain adamant in over the fact that they promised Becky that they wouldn't tell anyone. York tricks the twins by countering them with a fake promise and they divulge their secret. They were told to give Diane the box, and when they did, they were called back and were given a locket. Carol asked for the locket, but the twins persisted in delivering it. However, York mentions that Kaysen was present when Carol took the locket from Diane; as a result, Kaysen is labelled as a key witness and ordered not to leave the town.<\/p><p style=\"\">York goes over the events of the case again with Zach, focusing on Nick and Diane's visit to the art gallery, Quint's presence at Becky's house prior to the tragedy, Becky's sketch book and the twins' mysterious errands. At this point, Nick and Quint had no alibis for Becky's death, but York remains fixated on Diane Ames' suspiciousness. York rounds up the police force and proposes that they gather more information about Nick and Diane's relationship. George, Emily, and Thomas are assigned to watch the art gallery, the diner, and the bar, respectively.<\/p><h3>Episode 2 (part 2), Chapter 12: Fallen goddess<\/h3><p style=\"\">Later that night, the four get into position and begin tracking the actions of Nick and Diane. Emily waits across the street from the Galaxy of Terror with York just as it begins raining. Thomas tells them that Nick is leaving the bar while there's no strange reports from George at the gallery. Thomas joins Emily and York, and the three follow Nick to Muse's Gallery. However, just before arriving at the gallery, York barely dodges a truck and loses Nick. At the gallery, George reports that he hasn't seen Nick and that Diane hasn't left the area. When questioned whether he was feeling well, George admits to having a little drink, but insists that he's not drunk. York remains confident that Nick <i>is<\/i> inside regardless of George's diligence.<\/p><p style=\"\">Behind the gallery was a small cabin with a ladder leading underground. Just before York enters, Emily surprises him with her interest in him and Zach. As always, York tells her to stay put as he goes to investigate. As always, the site has now passed into the Other World, filled with Mysterious Shadows, and a new supernatural foe, the absurdly durable Wall Ladies. Based on evidence and profiling, York determined that Diane met with the Raincoat Killer and was murdered inside the gallery.<\/p><p style=\"\">After reaching the lobby of the gallery, York finds Nick unconscious on the ground with Diane's body hanging above the tree statue on display. Letting Emily, George and Thomas inside they discover that, like Becky, Diane isn't dead yet. In an attempt to make sure her body doesn't fall on the statue's sharp points, the surprisingly strong George begins moving it while York leaps from the second floor balcony to catch her. They recover Diane successfully and Emily tells Thomas to call an ambulance. However, Diane regains consciousness and inexplicably begins describing the tree statue as though giving a tour of the gallery, tongueless, with blood spouting out of her mouth. Nick, regaining consciousness himself, bumps George into the statue while resisting arrest. The statue starts falling as Emily tries unsuccessfully to get Diane out of the way. York quickly pushes Emily away, and Diane is crushed (literally <a href=\"\/gibs\/3015-334\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-334\">gibbed<\/a>) by the massive weight of the sculpture.<\/p><p style=\"\">Suddenly, Willie the dog arrives on the scene and York dutifully follows the dog to Diane's room. Inside, York finds a locked trap door, leading to a small alcove containing Kaysen. When asked what he was doing in the gallery, Kaysen confessed to being in a friends-with-benefits relation with Diane, and would often visit the town to engage in such frivolities. For his alibi, he stated that he and Diane were having a drink until Nick showed up and, by a change of heart, she locked him up in the alcove, thus relieving him of suspicion. However, he <i>did<\/i> hear footsteps that sounded like they were coming from heavy boots.<\/p><p style=\"\">York then takes the time to reassess the current situation with Zach, focusing on Nick's unconsciousness, Kaysen's presence, and the sound of bootsteps he heard. Also, he grows concerned for George, who feels guilty for unintentionally triggering the deaths of both Becky and Diane.<\/p><h3>Episode 2 (part 2), Chapter 13: Past<\/h3><p style=\"\">At the sheriff's department, George asks York if he could have a private discussion at the bar. There, the two have frank talks about the past, most of which came from George. He explains that the myriad scars on his back come from his childhood, when his mother would discipline George with the \"Tree Punishment\", where he'd be whipped with a tree branch repeatedly, claiming it hurt the tree more than it did him. Despite the trauma in his unhappy childhood, George has a bit of gratitude for his mother for shaping him into the man he is. He reaffirms his guilt over Becky and Diane's deaths and apologizes to York (who he finally calls that) for being arrogant. York assures him that he shouldn't feel bad and briefly leaves him to talk to Carol. With confidence, Carol says Nick wasn't responsible and begins singing (badly, although it is unclear whether it is the character's or just the voice actress' failing) onstage.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Carol's performance, Emily shows up and wishes to join George and York over drinks. George says he's had enough for the night and leaves York alone with Emily. The two have another discussion, this time revolving around Emily's past. She admits that George asked her out at one point and offers information about her parents, who died years ago. The two exit the bar and Emily leaves York with a strange request for him \"not to lie\".<\/p><p style=\"\">Back at the hotel, York once again goes over new details of the case with Zach. A new development that piqued his interest was the recentness of Nick's injury to the time of discovery. At this point in time, Nick becomes the most questionable person and the prime suspect.<\/p><p style=\"\">Just before turning in for the night, York hears a knock on his door and finds Emily on the other side when he opens it. York talks a bit about his own parents before Emily asks about Zach. York says that Zach is his only friend, but one he's never seen the face of. He \"met\" Zach when he was seven; he heard his mother crying, went to see what the problem was and saw his father pointing a gun at her. His father told the young York, \"At times we must purge things from this world because they should not exist, even if it means losing someone that you love.\" The elder Morgan then murdered York's mother and committed suicide. After fainting, York woke up, heard Zach's voice telling him everything would be alright, and became friends with him ever since.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emily thanks York for saving her life and leaves him for the night. Before falling asleep, he seems to think she is developing certain feelings for Zach, and jokingly declares himself and Zach rivals regarding Emily.<\/p><p style=\"\">The scene shifts to a freshly arrested Nick Cormack, who is begging a not-actually-present Thomas to let him out of his cell. His cries go unheard, as it appears the sheriff's office is completely empty. The scene shifts once more to Carol MacLaine, who's being comforted by an unidentified figure. Both are wearing the same red dress, and a picture suggests that Anna, Becky and Diane had very close ties to the murderer.<\/p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 14: Tea break<\/h3><p style=\"\">The third episode begins as York finds himself in a mysterious white room. He works his way through a maze of doors and comes face-to-face with an elderly man dressed in a white suit (actually a maskless Harry Stewart, although this is never openly commented on) who tells York that once he enters the door behind him, there's no turning back. With no other place to turn, York enters the last door and confronts a memory from his past: the moment in which his father held his mother at gunpoint. As the child version of York reached out to his mother, she becomes a Mysterious Shadow and started to attack.<\/p><p style=\"\">Waking up from the dream, York has another round of breakfast and coffee at the hotel. Much like the FK from before, the coffee left him with a lead. This time, the coffee left a ring on his newspaper, encircling the letters H-A-R-R-Y on an advertisement; with this, he leaves the hotel to pay the mysterious capitalist a visit. Outside of the hotel, Emily reports that Thomas has gone missing; while the police force goes searching for Thomas, York persists in visiting Harry. At this, Emily mutters how idiotic she was for thinking York was \"a good pick\".<\/p><p style=\"\">Inside Harry's mansion, he is greeted by Michael and tasked with solving a puzzle before meeting up with Harry. After solving the puzzle, Harry, who speaks for himself for the first time, offers York some tea and tells York that the red seeds that link all the murders in Greenvale and many more outside are found somewhere in the town, a place \"most crowded and most quiet [that] gives a cold sensation\". He will tell York more when he solves this riddle. The FBI Agent leaves the mansion to search for the red seeds.<\/p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 15: Red seed<\/h3><p style=\"\">York determines that the place he's looking for is the graveyard (which is crowded with the silent dead), and promptly heads there. There, he finds Brian the Insomniac and asks him if he's seen a tree that drops red seeds. Brian points toward the back end of the graveyard and brings three prominent red trees to York's attention. After fighting his way through several Mysterious Shadows, York takes a handful of red seeds and heads back to Harry's mansion.<\/p><p style=\"\">He is once again greeted by Michael, who tasks him with another silly puzzle, before he is able to reach Harry's room. York drops the red seeds as proof of his cleverness and Harry begins his explanation. He tells York a story about events that occurred in Greenvale fifty years ago. After the construction of the town clock tower, a man began wearing a red raincoat went mad murdered a large number of people. Under a gag order, the multiple homicide was kept under wraps by the military. York questions Harry's knowledge and he simply leaves him with the fact that he himself was an eyewitness to the Raincoat Killer's actions.<\/p><p style=\"\">Around ten to twenty years ago, Harry noticed something special about the red seeds and discovered a fabricated legend stating that eating the red seeds and murdering someone will grant a person immortality. He supposes that the current Raincoat Killer is using the old serial killer's methods to carry out the legend of the red seeds. He sends York to find old documents inside the sheriff's office proving the Raincoat Killer existed back in the 50's.<\/p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 16: Hidden memories<\/h3><p style=\"\">George still considers the Raincoat Killer mere folklore and Emily agrees, saying Harry just likes to playing with people's minds. However, York persists and Emily opens the file room for him to peruse. Inside, the file room has become a twisted labyrinth of the Other World. And when York reaches the end, he discovers the files he was looking for were completely removed shortly before he arrived. He questions George and Emily about the missing files and they remember that the missing Thomas has access to the file room at all times.<\/p><p style=\"\">York asks Emily for some coffee with milk on the side, claiming that it's very important. Once again, the coffee points him in another direction; more specifically, Velvet Falls, and requests a visit there. George complies with York's request since he's certain the waterfall will give them a bit of power in the least. York is certain he'll find something merely by fishing at the site, and the three temporarily cease their concern for Thomas' absence to head to the waterfall.<\/p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 17: New Raincoat Killer<\/h3><p style=\"\">York begins fishing and miraculously catches the missing documents from the waterfall. The three look at them with incredulity, as they are a clear outline for the Raincoat Killer's methods. George confirms that the documents were written by Thomas and York wishes to take them to Harry, stating that this proves the existence of the \"New Raincoat Killer\". Despite his dislike for Harry, George approves of York's actions while he and Emily search for Thomas.<\/p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 18: The 13th bell<\/h3><p style=\"\">When arriving at Harry's mansion, York enters and finds it has been affected by the Other World. Inside, he finds a painting of women in red dresses, resembling Anna, Becky, Diane, Carol and Emily, walking around a forest; also, he has visions of Emily and his father pointing a gun at her. When he reaches Harry's room, he discovers a secret passage leading to a small, underground base. The effects of the Other World subside, and he finds Harry in the midst of numerous monitors and bookshelves.<\/p><p style=\"\">After glancing over the documents, Harry tells his full story. One rainy night fifty years ago, he snuck out of his house after an argument with his father, intending to see and climb the new clock tower. At the top, he saw soldiers wearing gas masks, messing around with a device emitting purple smoke that was filling the town with purple fog. The bell began ringing, and he ran from the tower. The purple fog spread, and he headed home as the bell rang a thirteenth time. When he arrived in town, he discovered to his horror that under the influence of the purple fog, the townsfolk were running wild and berserk, viciously killing each other for no reason; most notably, there was an axe-wielding man in a red raincoat who was particularly strong taking out every person who challenged him. Just then, Harry himself was filled with rage and the urge to kill. He blindly attacked the man in the raincoat, and realized the man under the hood was his father. Immediately losing the fight, he was knocked out and woke up surrounded by dead bodies. His mother was among them, apparently slain by his father, the original Raincoat Killer. The town was taken over by the military, who suppressed all word of the purple fog incident and the devastating murders that resulted. Although they weren't allowed to tell even their children the truth about what had happened, the townsfolk never went out in the rain thereafter.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the event, the purple fog chemical absorbed into the ground, and to this day a small amount of purple gas is released whenever it rains, affecting the moods of anyone out in the rain at the time. Harry and York determine that the red seeds and the purple fog have a pronounced effect on the New Raincoat Killer. Just then, Harry's monitors alert him that Thomas has just been found and York gets ready to leave. However, Harry leaves York with an eerily familiar saying: \"At times, we must purge things from this world because they should not exist, even if it means losing someone that you love.\"<\/p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 19: Apartment<\/h3><p style=\"\">Outside of Harry's mansion, Emily pulls up they drive over to Thomas' apartment building. The two arrive and find George already on the scene; they received an anonymous call informing them that Thomas had returned home. York decides to head up to the apartment alone. He makes a startling discovery when he investigates the clues strewn around Thomas' apartment: it seems that somebody has entertained the Raincoat Killer at Thomas' house on at least one occasion. York surmises that Thomas is trying to insinuate that the mystery is deeper than it seems and that they need to look into the issue further as George and Emily burst into the room, worried over the sound of a vase shattering.<\/p><h3>Episode 3, Chapter 20: Cruel Device<\/h3><p style=\"\">As York leaves Thomas' apartment building, Emily and George leave hurriedly. Because it is after midnight, the entire town shifts into the Other World. Seeing Anna Graham once more, York leaves his car and chases after her on foot, believing she is leading him somewhere. He arrives at the Galaxy of Terror eventually, but Anna is scared off before he can speak to her by the sudden appearance of the New Raincoat Killer. York rushes into the bar as cover, but it's apparent that the bar, too is infested with Mysterious Shadows and Wall Ladies.<\/p><p style=\"\">York decides to profile the place to see what's going on, but the Raincoat Killer has also gotten entry to the bar and begins to chase him. After the New Raincoat Killer loses track of him on several occasions, York finds Thomas' sheriff badge and an ice pick. After another short encounter with the New Raincoat Killer, his conclusions lead him to be able to enter a certain room in the Galaxy, now back to normal. As York investigates, he discovers the locket that Anna had been holding when she died. Before he can do anything about it, however, he is knocked out by Thomas, who is <a href=\"\/cross-dressing\/3015-3705\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3705\">dressed as a woman<\/a>. As York lies handcuffed on the floor, Thomas dances to a recording of his sister singing.<\/p><h3>Episode 4, Chapter 21: Cat Fight<\/h3><p style=\"\">York, now actually seeing <i>himself<\/i> as a child, finds himself and his long-dead father in a forest. York calls out to to his father as he leaves him behind, who replies with \"Come on, boy! Or it'll be too late!\" This exchange is repeated several times as York follows his father through the forest at a rather sluggish pace. Eventually, York arrives in a small clearing with his father nowhere in sight. York is initially distraught, but a full-grown Emily appears before him in a red dress and consoles him. Willie the dog also appears and licks York's face.<\/p><p style=\"\">(Adult) York once again finds himself in the Red Room with Angels Isaach and Isaiah, as well as Anna, Becky, and Diane. The three women are seen whispering to one another and giggling while passing a bobblehead doll with the appearance of Forrest Kaysen between them. The twins, with extremely stoned looks on their faces, tell York that \"It's going to start soon\" and that \"the person he is waiting for\" will be here soon. Suddenly, one of the trees nearby begins to crack and burst, spraying what appears to be <a href=\"\/blood\/3015-512\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-512\">blood<\/a> all over the place.<\/p><p style=\"\">Back inside the secret chamber in the Galaxy of Terror, George and Emily are seen talking with Kaysen. Kaysen had told them that he saw York enter the bar, and they had gone inside to investigate. Kaysen then gets the idea to have Willie track York's scent. George stays behind to investigate some more, and Emily (now the playable character) and Kaysen follow Willie as he runs in circles through the central section of Greenvale. During this sequence, the perspective occasionally switches to York who is blindfolded in an unknown location. He tries, unsuccessfully, to reason with Thomas and reminisces over his time spent with Emily, whom he has grown to deeply care for.<\/p><p style=\"\">After entirely too much time has passed, Emily, Kaysen, and Willie arrive at the Greenvale Community Center. Following York's example, Emily tells Kaysen to wait outside and goes inside by herself to investigate. To her initial shock and horror, she finds herself in the Other World, fighting Mysterious Shadows just as York has. Emily, armed with a special Sheriff's Department-issued handgun that is inexplicably <i>far<\/i> more powerful than York's FBI-issued handgun, makes her way to the top of the clock tower and confronts Thomas, who now reveals himself to be <a href=\"\/insanity\/3015-1503\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1503\">totally insane<\/a>. She, too, fails to reason with him, and the first boss battle of the game finally commences. Emily fires at Thomas while he leaps across spinning gears, while Thomas attacks by swinging large hooks towards Emily and occasionally firing his revolver at her. After defeating him, Thomas makes strange comments indicating that he is intensely jealous of Emily, and pulls a knife, but is thwarted by the sudden intervention of Willie, who bites his arm. Thomas' knife gets knocked into the air and stabs him in his chest, then he falls from the gear and is impaled through the head on a sharp hook.<\/p><p style=\"\">With Thomas dead, Willie unties York, who berates Emily for letting \"the killer\" get away. Emily expresses confusion, having assumed that the clearly psychotic Thomas was the murderer. York reveals that he has determined although Thomas was an accomplice, he was not the actual killer. Instead, the murderer is \"Love G\" himself, the person Thomas was in love with, the person whose affection towards Emily made Thomas jealous, the one person who does not have an alibi for any of the killings.<\/p><p style=\"\">Sheriff George Woodman is the New Raincoat Killer.<\/p><p style=\"\">York explains to a completely shocked Emily that while George does not have a <i>tattoo<\/i> on his back, there is a <i>pattern<\/i> there amongst the scars. York has Kaysen drop himself and Emily off at the sheriff's office.<\/p><h3>Episode 4, Chapter 22: The Throne of Abyss<\/h3><p style=\"\">At the sheriff's office, York orders Kaysen to stay at the entrance, but asks for Emily to secure the back of the building. As he heads into the sheriff's office, which once again seems to be in the Other World, he plans on tracking down George. He sees an apparition of Anna again, this time running through a door, and he follows her, eventually finding a cunningly hidden key for a hidden room. The hidden room, it seems, is contained within one of the holding cells in the basement as he discovers when Anna runs through it again. After York manages to obtain the key and enter the room, which is set up as an almost religious motif towards the red seeds and the murders, he finds Carol's earrings - and Carol herself.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emily bursts into the room, and both she and York stare at Carol calmly brushing her hair, with clumps of it falling to the floor. As blood drips onto Emily's face, she looks up to see a freshly drawn \"inverted peace mark\" symbol on the ceiling, drawn with blood. Carol seems in too much pain to be aware as Emily calls out to her, and she collapses to the floor. As Emily rushes over to help her out, she struggles to speak without her tongue, but obviously wanting to speak of Thomas, Emily sadly explains that she had to kill him. Carol, now communicating through writing on the floor in her own blood, tells them that she and Thomas were \"substitutes\", and that George really loves Emily. Suddenly enraged, Carol grabs some red seeds and shoves them into Emily's mouth. York pulls Emily away, Carol finally dies, and Emily is inexplicably sickened by the brief contact with the seeds.<\/p><p style=\"\">Screaming for Kaysen, York gets Emily out of the building and into Kaysen's truck, ordering him to take Emily straight to the hospital to cleanse her stomach and liver. When he finds out that York intends to go after George, Kaysen protests, wanting York to come with them, but he refuses. Kaysen leaves with Emily, as George stands over Carol's body in his New Raincoat Killer get up and starts laughing maniacally.<\/p><h3>Episode 5, Chapter 23: Dawn<\/h3><p style=\"\">George, now fully decked out as the New Raincoat Killer, briefly appears at the door, taunting York and disappearing inside. York pursues him, musing about asking Emily out on a date when the case is over. As York battles his way through the sheriff's office, which hasn't yet returned to normal and is stuffed full of Mysterious Shadows in police uniforms, he comes across the New Raincoat Killer. Instead of running and hiding, York continues doggedly chasing him, despite having axes thrown at him. They return to the hidden room under the police department, and York ascends a giant staircase that leads him outside of the police station, and straight to George.<\/p><p style=\"\">Having doffed his raincoat, George and York talk. George, now wearing a ridiculous outfit, enthuses over what a powerful town Greenvale is, and its two treasures: the red seeds and their power, and Emily herself. He reminisces over when Emily first came to Greenvale and how it made him feel like a fool when she turned him down, which York cuttingly agrees with. George turns this around by saying that if anybody's a fool it's York, for watching Becky, Diane and Carol die right in front of him and being unable to do anything about it. He also explains that he learned from his mother that the strong will always overpower the weak and that it's \"good and right\" for such a thing to happen, casually mentioning that he got the wicked scar on his face when his abusive mother put her stiletto heel through his cheek. Now that he has completed all the murders required for the red seed legend, George feels that he's now divine, and all he needs now is Emily, the goddess, to be his bride, despite York saying such a plan won't work.<\/p><p style=\"\">George also explains about how, when he was deer hunting, he shot some deer that just wouldn't die, no matter how many bullets he pumped into them. Although he wondered if they were perhaps <a href=\"\/undead\/3015-1155\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1155\">undead<\/a> zombie deer, It turned out that they had red seeds in their stomach, and he concluded that those seeds really had made them invincible. George, declaring himself the \"chosen one\", then eats more red seeds and transforms, his body becoming more muscular, revealing that the red seeds really do possess supernatural traits after all. George and York then fight, with George wielding his axe to minimum effect.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon losing to York, George talks about the involvement of the four women he killed. He explains that Carol, Thomas and George had a secret \"club\", and Becky and Anna immediately joined. When they met, George fed them the seeds and sleazily discusses their reactions, apparently acting as an aphrodisiac to the women, and why he chose Anna to be the first. York tries to break down what he's saying in terms of a murderer and his victims, and his framing of Thomas, which amuses George. He claims that it's thanks to Thomas in the first case that George had even heard the legend of the Raincoat Killer, even though he hadn't believed in it. George believes his life's misfortunes were really just trials on the way to him becoming divine, and his body transforms again, both his hair and skin texture changing until he barely looks human at all.<\/p><p style=\"\">Despite his superhuman power, George loses the fight again and totally breaks down, crying and apologizing to his mother for having murdered the girls, babbling about having done nothing wrong, and that it's really the fault of the \"he\" who gave him a present: the locket that George was told makes him the Chosen One. Pulling himself together, they go to fight again, but York dispatches George with ease as York shoots George's axe back at him, leaving it embedded in his chest. Before he can even fall down and die from his fatal wound, lightning strikes the axe, killing George, leaving his body charred and blackened, casting the shadow of an inverted peace sign. The New Raincoat Killer is finally dead. However, York is knocked out by his proximity to the lightning.<\/p><h3>Episode 5, Chapter 24: Red tree<\/h3><p style=\"\">Young York runs through a corridor of red leaves, talking to Angel Isaiah and Isaach, the four \"goddesses\", Thomas (still cross-dressed), and his mother, who all impart some kind of advice or encouragement, as well as his father, who basically acts like a dick. As he goes through the door at the end of the corridor, he finds Harry, once more without his mask on, and Emily. Harry apologizes that he can't let York go with his parents, but that he needs to open an envelope. York looks into it, but it isn't clear what he sees.<\/p><p style=\"\">(Adult) York wakes up at the hospital with Dr. Johnson at his bedside, and immediately inquires about how Emily is doing. Dr. Johnson expresses surprise at his question, and explains that Emily hasn't come to the hospital, and when York explains that he told Kaysen to bring Emily to the hospital, Dr. Johnson comments that Kaysen was the one who brought York. He also left an envelope for York, identical to the one in his dream, containing a crudely-drawn map of where he should go. York follows the directions, and finds himself at the late George Woodman's house.<\/p><p style=\"\">George's house appears to be empty, with everything taped up and the doors covered. York discovers a door to the basement, though, which turns out to be a bedroom. Every available surface is covered with photos of Emily, which disturbs York. In another room in the basement, York finds the dessicated corpse of a long-dead woman in a chair, which seems to have saplings growing from it, and remarks upon it being George's mother. As he picks the sapling from the body, York recognizes the shadow it makes - the presumed \"inverted peace mark\" is actually a tree. He connects it to the similar sapling Kaysen carries around with him at all times, as well as his coffee premonitions, and concludes that the \"he\" George referred to was in fact Forrest Kaysen. York finds a note written on a photograph of Kaysen and George together telling him to go to the Community Center.<\/p><h3>Episode 6, Chapter 25: Zach Morgan<\/h3><p style=\"\">In 1956, Greenvale went crazy. The original Raincoat Killer (currently controlled by the player) fights his way through the rest of the townsfolk to the Community Center and its clocktower before it strikes 13. As he stares up, he sees the soldiers operating the purple fog machine, and the gas billowing out into the air. It is revealed that one of the soldiers is in fact Forrest Kaysen, who looks exactly as he does today, proving his seed-bound immortality. Watching the town go to Hell, Kaysen laughs manically while the Raincoat Killer rages on the ground far beneath him.<\/p><p style=\"\">The player regains control of York as he, too, stands staring up at the clocktower, fifty years later. It is revealed that the purple fog has once again enveloped Greenvale, and behind York, all the formerly friendly citizens of Greenvale (and Jack) come towards him, looking ready to kill him. Isaach and Isaiah run up behind the inexplicably immune York, claiming they're scared of how strangely other people are acting, but they are obviously affected too, as they stab him in the leg with a pair of scissors. Reluctant to hurt the people who don't know what they're doing, York backs away into the Community Center (Alternatively, the player slaughters them all without mercy).<\/p><p style=\"\">As he steps through the door, York enters the \"white\" other world and is warned of the finality of his decision to proceed. Undeterred, he goes straight into the theatre, where Emily is sitting down, apparently sleeping, a plant sitting on her lap. York tells Kaysen that George is dead, but Forrest seems to find the whole thing hilarious, dismissing George as \"small-minded and stupid\". Kaysen mocks York for leaving Emily alone with him, and salivates about the fun he's had with Emily, bragging about what he did. Impatient, York shoots at him, but Kaysen goads him deliberately by kissing Emily when she's confused and believes that it's York. He also reveals his long, lizard-like tongue, which knocks Emily into wakefulness.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emily apologizes to York for kissing Kaysen, but he dismisses it and tells her he'll take her to the hospital. Emily explains that she can't go to him as she's been \"soiled\", which York vehemently denies. As she gets up to explain herself somewhat hysterically, the blanket that had been across her body drops to the floor and York sees that she's nearly naked and a sapling is growing straight out of her stomach. Seeing York's expression, Kaysen gleefully repeats one of his first lines, about how growing his saplings requires a \"certain technique\" that only he knows, and laughs hysterically.<\/p><p style=\"\">Emily begs for York to kill her and prevent the sapling from growing and bringing more red seeds into the world, and York begs Zach for guidance. He has a flashback to the day his parents died, but it's different - the truth is no longer repressed or changed by trauma. Once again, young York watches from the doorway, but this time, Forrrest Kaysen is in the room with his mother and father, and it is apparent that his mother has a sapling growing from her stomach. Like Emily did to York, York's mother begs his father to kill her. His father begs Kaysen to let her go, but Kaysen says that when it progresses so far, there's nothing even he can do about it. His father can't bring himself to shoot the woman he loves, which Kaysen finds hilarious, and the sapling suddenly undergoes a horrible growth spurt, fully sprouting as York's mother dies in agony, her body shrivelling and becoming disfigured. Weeping bitterly, York's father sees the boy standing in the doorway, and gives the now familiar speech about removing things from the world even if it means losing someone you love, and then cowardly shoots himself in the head.<\/p><p style=\"\">However...<\/p><p style=\"\">When he speaks to the boy standing in the door, he calls him <i>Zach<\/i>, not <i>York<\/i>. It is revealed that the man the player has been controlling the entire game is really named Francis <i>Zach<\/i> Morgan, and that <i>York<\/i> was the imaginary friend who appeared after the death of his parents. In reality, the man's hair is white, not brown, and the scar over his eye is painful-looking, not long-healed, which explains the townspeople's obsession with it. Unable to deal with the impossibly traumatic scene he'd witnessed, York had \"traded places\" with Zach, becoming the dominant personality and not letting him remember the truth about the incident or perceiving the way he really looked. The flashback ends with Kaysen telling Zach that he saw him and striking him.<\/p><p style=\"\">We then witness the moment the man's personality changed so drastically. In the white room, young Zach, with white hair and blood splattered around his eye from the wound Kaysen just inflicted on him, stands horrified at what he'd just seen. Young York shows up and proclaims himself Zach's friend who'll be there forever to help him get through the trauma. As young Zach takes young York's hand, the flashback ceases and the player takes control of an adult FBI Agent Francis Zachary Morgan, white hair, ugly scar, and all. Zach recalls that he traded places with his alternate personality, York, after the incident. Zach is now the one begging York for guidance, but York says he must decide for himself, although he'll back him up whatever decision he makes.<\/p><p style=\"\">In one of these choices, Zach tries to shoot Emily as she asks, but finds himself unable to do so, deliberately missing instead. Unlike Zach's mother, Emily decides to take matters into her own hands and rips the sapling from her body, causing <i>incredible<\/i> damage to her internal organs, but killing the plant before it could bloom. While Kaysen inexplicably rejoices, Zach runs to Emily to try and comfort her in her final moments. She smiles at his compliments, and then he sees her in the White Room, going to join the rest of the \"goddesses\" (and the murderous, psychopathic Thomas, for some reason). She claims to now understand both York and Zach, and as Zach watches, the familiar figure of York goes over to join them. He encourages Zach, and Zach finally is able to talk to Emily himself. When he is pulled out of that world, Emily lies dead on the theatre stage, and Zach covers her with his jacket.<\/p><p style=\"\">Kaysen is surprised and enraged about Zach having been brought back from the red room, and uses the power granted him by the seeds to transform into a disgusting, slimy creature. Zach defeats him, and Kaysen complains about the foolishness of humans and how they react to the gas created from the red seeds. Watching the effects of the seeds gives him something to laugh at in his centuries-long life. Proclaiming he's had enough fun for one day and that it's time for Zach to die, Kaysen transforms again and becomes even bigger. He stomps on the floor and Zach falls through it, into an impossibly huge under-chamber with a spiral staircase. Kaysen follows Zach down himself, and starts to chase Zach as he runs up to the clocktower.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Zach bursts through the door to the clocktower, Kaysen rushes through after him and is flung off the side of the clocktower. The battle isn't over, though, as he transforms one final time into a giant version of Kaysen's original humanoid appearance, peering into the clocktower and clutching a bobblehead version of himself. Kaysen's entire body is invulnerable, but he takes damage when Zach shoots the bobblehead. This time, when Zach defeats him, his face opens up and tentacles and a giant eyeball protrudes from where it used to be, which Zach shoots while commenting on Kaysen's lack of understanding of humans. This time, Forrest Kaysen is killed for reals, once and for all, and with him dead, the red seeds will eventually disappear from this world.<\/p><p style=\"\">All of the citizens of Greenvale wake up from their temporary insanity, confused. Miraculously, nobody killed each other while under the influence of the gas, which disappeared once Kaysen died. Meanwhile, Francis Zach Morgan descends the clocktower and returns to Emily's body, picking it up and talking to it about how she ended up with York after all. He deliberately steps on Kaysen's bobblehead on the way out.<\/p><h3>Episode 7, Chapter 26: Epilogue<\/h3><p style=\"\">At Harry Stewart's mansion, Zach looks at the painting of the \"goddesses\", noting this time that it also depicts a cross-dressing Thomas. Harry comes over in his wheelchair and asks Zach whether he believed any of the story he'd told him. Zach considers it unimportant, given that he couldn't save Emily, but Harry expresses sympathy about what happened anyway. He talks about the strangeness of the painting, but Zach wants to know about Harry's last name. Harry admits that \"Harry Stewart\" isn't his actual name; it's Harry <i>Woodman<\/i>, and he is George's biological father. When asked about his presence in the White Room, he evades the question, saying that Kaysen had put him in the same situation as Zach's father and Zach himself, and that much like the two of them, he'd also been unable to shoot the woman he loved. Being made of stronger stuff than Zach's father, though, he didn't kill himself either, resulting in losing both his wife and son, George blaming Harry for his mother's death. Harry, too, still blames himself for what happened, but he's glad Zach has at long last put an end to the madness. Zach ponders about the happiness of the victims, but Harry assures him that York will guide them to the forest.<\/p><p style=\"\">Later, being driven back to the hotel by Michael, Zach spots Emily in the woods. He excuses himself and goes over to the area where he saw her, finding Jim, the twins, and Willie. He and Jim talk about the sadness of what has happened in Greenvale, and how the twins are doing. The twins then come and give something to Zach, claiming it's from Emily, as she's too shy to pass it along herself. She is, however, there with \"another Zach\". The twins tell Zach how much Emily likes him, but he claims she really loves York instead. As Jim and the twins wander off, Zach talks to York and Emily, explaining that he's figured out the <i>real<\/i> reason George put Anna's body in the forest: he wanted the twins to find her. Without explaining this totally bizarre statement, Zach says his final goodbyes to York, Emily, the \"goddesses\", and Thomas, and leaves the woods.<\/p><p style=\"\">After dealing with any further business, Zach makes up his mind to leave Greenvale with the case solved. As he signs out of the Great Deer Yard Hotel, he spots Polly's photograph from the construction of the clocktower. Kaysen is in it, looking just as he always has, of course. Shrugging it off, Zach talks to Polly about his \"very good friend who he can't speak to anymore\", and Polly sympathizes but expresses her opinion that his friend will be fine. Grinning, Zach agrees with her assessment.<\/p><p style=\"\">Leaving any cars he may have bought from the General behind, Zach leaves town on foot. As he leaves Greenvale for the last time, Zach is watched by Willie, who has the doll of Kaysen in his mouth, and a bee flies off into the distance.<\/p><p style=\"\">Meanwhile, in the afterlife, which looks strangely like the A&amp;G Diner, York and Emily enthusiastically kiss while Anna, Becky, Carol, Diane, and Thomas look on happily.<\/p><h2>System Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7 \/ Vista (32\/64 bit) <\/li><li><strong>Processor: <\/strong>Intel Dual Core 2.0Ghz or equivalent <\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM <\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 512MB RAM <\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 9.0c <\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive: <\/strong>8 GB available space <\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Direct X compatible sound card<\/li><\/ul><h3>Recommended<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7 \/ Vista (32\/64 bit) <\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Quad Core 1.6Ghz \/ AMD Quad Core 1.6Ghz <\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM <\/li><li><strong>Graphics: <\/strong>DirectX 9.0c compatible NVIDIA or AMD ATI video card with 1GB of RAM; Nvidia GeForce GTX 260 or higher; ATI Radeon HD 4890 or higher <\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 9.0c <\/li><li><strong>Hard Drive:<\/strong> 8 GB available space <\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Direct X compatible sound card<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/2080532-box_dprem.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/2080532-box_dprem.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/2080532-box_dprem.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2080532-box_dprem.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/2080532-box_dprem.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/2080532-box_dprem.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/2080532-box_dprem.png"},"name":"Deadly Premonition"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions features four dimensions (Amazing, Noir, 2099, and Ultimate), each representing a different interpretation of the <a href=\"\/spider-man\/3005-69\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-69\">Spider-Man<\/a> character found in <a href=\"\/marvel\/3025-173\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-173\">Marvel<\/a> comics.

Spider-Man is forced to accept. On the show he faces Deadpool\u2019s fanboys and a tidal wave until he get\u2019s his final showdown with Deadpool. Deadpool gives Spider-Man the tablet without a fight saying that he earned it and asks Spider-Man about the fragments cababilities. Spider-Man realizes that the Tablet is fake to late when Deadpool uses the Tablet to create clones of himself. Eventually Spider-Man defeats Deadpool and gains another fragment.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the end of the second act, Amazing Spider-Man hands the Tablet to Madame Web where Mysterio ambushes them. There he threatens to take Web from her life support system if the rest of the Tablets aren\u2019t collected for him.

Juggernaut accidently takes the fragment and tries to flee from Sable. When Spider-Man realizes this he grabs the tracer on Juggernaut used by Sable and throws it across the city leaving Juggernaut and him alone. Juggernaut throws Spider-Man into a warehouse when Sable returns to the fray. When she spots Spider-Man she makes him the secondary target for the bounty on his head and he must evade them while retrieving the Tablet from Juggernaut. Juggernaut runs to the top of the new Oscorp building still under construction. Spider-Man slams Juggernaut through multiple floors demolishing the building. At the bottom Juggernaut finds the fragment and uses it to become more powerful. However the power of the fragment reacts poorly with the crimson gem which gives Juggernaut powers rendering him vulnerable to attack. Juggernaut succumbs to Spider-Man\u2019s beating allowing Amazing to collect the last Tablet.<\/p><p style=\"\">Spider-Man Noir has finally located The Goblin at an abandoned Carnival. The Goblin uses the Tablet from the start transforming his already deformed appearance to a form that most resembles a goblin. The Goblin repeatedly ambushes Spider-Man while they both get deeper and deeper into the Carnival. Eventually Spider-Man gets to the center of the Carnival where he and Goblin battle it out with the electricity in the tent going hay wire turning the lights on and off. Eventually Goblin gets more aggressive and uses large pillars to attack Spider-Man using his henchmen as distractions. The pillars are to large to swing quickly leaving Goblin open to attack from Noir. Noir eventually takes down The Goblin and collects his last fragment.<\/p><p style=\"\">Spider-Man 2099 sneaks into Alchemax where he finds a woman with metal arms working on a machine. The lady reveals herself to be Doctor Octopus 2099 and intends to use the Tablet as a power source for her new invention, essentially a doomsday device. 2099 decides to remove the back up battery system for the security device guarding the invention. Eventually he gets back to the machine where Doc Ock uses it to power herself and her invention. Spider-Man eventually removes some auxiliary battery systems on the machine and must face Ock one on one. 2099 wins the battle and collect his last fragment.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1448274-44_vf_spidermanshattereddimensions_ama_1500_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1448274\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1448274-44_vf_spidermanshattereddimensions_ama_1500_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1448274\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/669\/1448274-44_vf_spidermanshattereddimensions_ama_1500_13.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Carnage (Ultimate)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Ultimate Spider-Man decides to go to the SHIELD base to ask them for help in finding the fragment but arrives to find that the base is in turmoil. Spider-Man enters the base to see symbiotic, red webbing sprawled across the base with corpses drained of their blood. The corpses reanimate however and attack Spidey en masse much to Spider-Man\u2019s surprise. Spider-Man rescues a scientist who explains that SHIELD has found the last fragment and tried to test it on Carnage and that Carnage used it to escape and reanimate the people he killed. Spider-Man must find Carnage while dealing with tons of symbiote zombies with airships crashing from the sky. SHIELD deploys robots that can tell the difference between Spider-Man in his suit and Carnage so that they may team up to defeat the failed clone. The robots are able to destroy Carnage\u2019s nest so Spider-Man may attack him. Carnage is then trapped under a pillar and set on fire while Spider-Man takes the last fragment.<\/p><p style=\"\">Spider-Man returns to Madame Web\u2019s hideout and attempts to launch a surprise attack on Mysterio but fails and all of the fragments are put back together with Mysterio as its holder. Mysterio then breaks the dimensional barrier combining worlds. The Spider-Man take turn to try and break his helmet apart using their various abilities. The Spider-Men succeeds in regaining the completed Tablet as well as defeating Mysterio. The four Spider-Men say their goodbyes and return to their own universes with each proclaiming that they are the best out of them all.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><ul><li><b>OS:<\/b> Windows XP \/ Vista \/ 7<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Processor:<\/b> Pentium(R) Intel Core\u00ae 2 Duo 2.6 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800 or better<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>RAM Memory:<\/b> 1 GB (XP) \/ 2 GB (Vista &amp; Win 7)<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Graphics Card:<\/b> GeForce 9600 GT 512 MB or Radeon HD 3870 or better<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Sound Card:<\/b> DirectX 9.0c compatible<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Hard Disk Space:<\/b> 7 GB<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>DirectX:<\/b> 9.0c<\/li><\/ul><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"\/original-soundtrack\/3015-189\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">original score<\/a> for <i>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions<\/i> was composed by <a href=\"\/james-michael-dooley\/3040-87594\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-87594\">James Dooley<\/a>.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>Track #<\/th><th>Song Title<\/th><th>Running Time<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>01<\/td><td><b>Enter the Web-Head<\/b><\/td><td>01.10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>02<\/td><td><b>Web of Destiny<\/b><\/td><td>01.18<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>03<\/td><td><b>Worthy Prey<\/b><\/td><td>02.14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>04<\/td><td><b>Worthy Prey 2<\/b><\/td><td>02.14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>05<\/td><td><b>Worthy Prey 3<\/b><\/td><td>02.14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>06<\/td><td><b>VS.

He quickly uses his detached head and hair as a fan to blow air up a nymph's skirt (to her aggravation and awkward satisfaction) and continues running amok until he is literally slapped in the face by his Double -- his blood brother, his id -- a <a href=\"\/globox\/3005-4646\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4646\">Globox<\/a> who somehow has a magical connection to him. The two are an inseparable pair and look to cause general mayhem around this new Rayman universe.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Rayman: Origins's gameplay is focused on jumping, gliding, slapping and climbing. Enemies and obstacles are either deftly avoided or quickly dealt with and include some familiar elements from <a href=\"\/rayman\/3030-18473\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18473\">Rayman<\/a> and <a href=\"\/rayman-2-the-great-escape\/3030-609\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-609\">Rayman 2<\/a>. At the end of each level, Rayman (or whomever the player chooses to be) will free some Electoons from a cage, though in most of the normal levels there is also two other hidden cages throughout the level. Additional Electoons may also be earned when the player collects enough Lums, or by completing the level in a given amount of time. The collection of Electoons unlocks playable characters and Treasure Hunt levels. These levels feature Rayman chasing a treasure chest through tightly scripted sequences, that are both chaotic and exhilarating, and includes elements such as falling boulders that block the players path, and a pirate ship that shoots the platforms from under the player's feet. Aside from normal levels and Treasure Hunt levels, the game also contains \"Shoot'em up\" sequences and boss battles, all with multiple side missions for getting extra Electoons.<\/p><p style=\"\">The co-op gameplay does not have players killing each other, though the players can slap each other (which can lead to death if they are knocked into harmful obstacles, enemies, or a bottomless pit).

Approximately 40% of the game occurs across the sea, as the other 60% remains on land - with \"50 unique locations\" including fisherman villages, jungles, temples, plantations, forts, complete islands, and Mayan ruins. Each of the areas have different gameplay focuses. For example, the Mayan ruins are based around puzzle solving and platforming, while the Coconut Islands are inhabited by enemies to fight.<\/p><p style=\"\">The three largest cities, however, are Naussau (the pirate haven), Kingston (a lively, dangerous town), and Havana (the capital of Cuba). The team that worked on <a href=\"\/far-cry-3\/3030-32933\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32933\">Far Cry 3<\/a>'s open world design pitched in to add to the random elements and overall design of the Caribbean world. Added randomness includes storms and rain, which simple make things wet on land but add dangerous rogue waves and lack of visibility on sea.<\/p><p style=\"\">In major ports and on minor islands, Kenway can collect treasure chests (some of which include plans for upgrades for his ship), animus fragments ( 200 glowing Macguffins of the past), sea chanties (songs for his crew to sing aboard the <em>Jackdaw), <\/em>and secret letters revealing the backstory of a mysterious character.<\/p><p style=\"\">While sailing, randomly generated supplies and shipwrecked crewmen can be collected.<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Fighting on land<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\">With the addition of free aiming, Kenway can carry up to four guns and use them in one go. Cutlasses, swords, axes, rifles, and pistols are available. Using the d-pad, players select Kenway's primary weapons (swords, hands, or hidden blades) and his secondary weapons (pistols, smoke bombs, rope darts, sleeping darts, or berzerk darts) for use in battle. The same parry-into-combo system from previous games returns, with a successful parry and kill leading into the ability to chain kills quickly. In addition, quickly hitting the secondary button with pistols equipped will fire off a volley of up to four chained shots, potentially killing four enemies in a few seconds.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495911\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495911\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/2840\/2495911-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_006.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Kenway executes an island guard<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Kenway now regains health only over time when out of battle, leaving behind the health regenerating potions of previous games. This means that the player must decide whether to run or fight it out when low on health.<\/p><p style=\"\">Assassination techniques of air, ground, double, and running assassinations make their return. Added here is the ability to tag enemies using Eagle Vision. If the player looks at enemies for a few seconds in this vision mode, a dot will appear over their heads and, upon returning to regular vision, that enemy will be highlighted. Highlighted enemies appear through walls, making awareness of their status and tracking them (especially during eavesdropping missions) far easier.<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Fighting on sea<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\">Kenway's greatest ally is his ship, The <em>Jackdaw. <\/em>Acquired during the story, the ship grows with the player's input. Salvaging supplies from warehouses or the open sea can give the player materials to upgrade the ship, but in order to truly improve her, the player must fight, incapacitate, and board other ships. Doing so will net the greatest amount of money, crew, ammunition, and upgrade materials in the form of cloth, wood, or metal. Using a spyglass reveals what each ship is carrying, its level (strength vs. the player's strength), and its type (gunboat, schooner, brig, frigate, or man o' war).<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/28122\/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578670\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/28122\/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2578670\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/2\/28122\/2578670-thunderbattle.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>During a fort battle, smaller ships often attack as well<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Revising the system from Assassin's Creed III, AC IV places each type of ship-board weapon at a different location on the ship. When the player looks forward, they can fire the chain shot, which takes down enemy sails and makes them less maneuverable. Looking to either side brings up the aiming arc of the broadside cannons, the general damage weapon. Simply hitting the fire button from the side view will fire heavy shot, a flaming, short range attack that does massive damage. The back view will fire exploding barrels behind the player. Additionally, when acquired mortars can be fired at any time, with their button generating an aiming circle that can be moved side to side and forward and backward.<\/p><p style=\"\">Successful destruction of an enemy ship results in explosions and burning sails, but it also gives the player the ability to board the ship. Choosing to board puts the player in control of Kenway with escalating requirements for success based on the power of the ship. While schooners simple require five dead crewmen, man o' wars require 20 dead, a destroyed flag, or killed officers or gunmen, or destroyed powder stores.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon successful boarding, the player can choose to repair their own ship by destroying this one, lower their sea-based wanted level by converting the ship, or send the ship to the second-screen and general mini-game Kenway's Fleet.<\/p><p style=\"\">To take down forts that reveal sections of islands on the map and make areas less dangerous, the player must attack the stationary target while it fires cannon, heavy shot, and mortars at the <em>Jackdaw. <\/em><\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Present Day Abstergo Entertainment<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\">The player takes on the role of an <a href=\"\/abstergo-industries\/3015-2653\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2653\">Abstergo Industries<\/a> employee in October 2013, rather than that of <a href=\"\/desmond-miles\/3005-305\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-305\">Desmond Miles<\/a>, who is dead.

One is a spherical puzzle where the player needs to direct the cursor onto a green line. The second is a frogger-like grid where the player's cursor must cross multiple moving lines, some of them red and deadly, to get to the other side. The final is a mathematical graph where the player is given a final number to reach and multiple single numbers to multiply together. Some later terminals require multiple mini-games to break into. Successful hacking reveals recordings of Desmond, subject zero, and emails, books, and movies from Abstergo marketing and development.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players can also explore the offices, finding collectible sticky notes from a deranged person, listening to employee banter, and accessing secure areas.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Multiplayer<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/2495904-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495904\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2840\/2495904-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2495904\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/2840\/2495904-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag_2013_06-10-13_011.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>As in previous games, multiplayer centers around templar avatars, some of whom Kenway kills in the single player.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The multiplayer side of Assassin's Creed 4 features six different competitive game modes, a 4 player co-op mode, and introduces Gamelab, a way to create custom matches:<\/p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Free-For-All modes<\/h3><p style=\"\"><strong>Deathmatch<\/strong> - The player is given an assassination contract of another player.

The characters are also quite detailed, mostly in the facial animations and body movement. From a gameplay perspective, the design is either usually centered on a puzzle that must be solved, through use of the <a href=\"\/\">Gravity Gun<\/a> or some trigger in the environment, or fire-fights between you and the AI.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1085313\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1085313\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Vortigaunts are still present and are eager to help the player.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous entries in the series; this is a First Person Shooter, with much of the trappings of what you expect an FPS to have. Unlike most modern FPSs, the game includes many puzzle-based game mechanics while leaving out <a href=\"\/iron-sights\/3015-567\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-567\">iron sights<\/a>. The movement style also hearkens back to earlier eras. Whereas in more modern games movement is slower and feels heavier, HL2: Episode 2 maintains the fast paced movement style that is becoming less frequent. The one big game mechanic that has been a centerpiece since <a href=\"\/\">Half-Life 2<\/a>, the <a href=\"\/\">Gravity Gun<\/a>, is back, thus allowing you to manipulate the environment by picking up and throwing objects.<\/p><h3>New in Episode Two<\/h3><p style=\"\">One significant change from past games is the inclusion of large vehicle sections. While <a href=\"\/\">Half-Life 2<\/a> also had vehicle sections, they felt more isolate and closed off from the rest of the game, being only seen in one level before moving on. In Episode 2, you gain a vehicle early on and traveling through most of the game with it. Throughout the game, there are areas that can be explored on the driving paths that are optional, but give rewards such as ammo and health.<\/p><p style=\"\">Valve has said that each Episode (from 1-3) has been built around a specific design choice that would allow them to further experiment with their <a href=\"\/\">Source<\/a> engine and how they create games. With Episode 1 it was the inclusion of a highly sophisticated AI partner, <a href=\"\/\">Alyx Vance<\/a>, who accompanied you throughout most of the game. In Episode 2, the new game mechanic was that of augmenting Valves <a href=\"\/\">Source<\/a> engine to allow for much more open environments and larger scale battles, as illustrated by the final battle in the game and the many large open forest areas you encounter throughout the game.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>To the White Forest<\/h3><p style=\"\">Half Life 2: Episode Two starts hours after the events of Half Life 2: Episode 1. Gordon finds himself mildly injured and trapped inside the same train on which he and <a href=\"\/alyx-vance\/3005-640\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-640\">Alyx Vance<\/a> departed from <a href=\"\/city-17\/3035-63\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-63\">City 17<\/a> only <a href=\"\/half-life-2-episode-one\/3030-14328\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14328\">hours earlier<\/a>.

After making radio contact with the resistance headquarters at <a href=\"\/white-forest\/3035-121\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-121\">White Forest<\/a>, Gordon and Alyx are informed by <a href=\"\/eli-vance\/3005-639\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-639\">Eli<\/a> and <a href=\"\/isaac-kleiner\/3005-641\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-641\">Dr. Kleiner<\/a> that the data packet recovered in Episode 1 is the Combine\u2019s portal code, and that it is this code that allows the Combine to control the super portal from their home world. <a href=\"\/arne-magnusson\/3005-2617\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2617\">Dr. Arne Magnusson<\/a> hypothesizes that the resistance can use the code shut down the portal and effectively shut off the Combine from earth for good.

A nearby <a href=\"\/vortigaunt\/3015-221\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-221\">Vortigaunt<\/a> senses the trouble and comes just in time to save an unconscious Alyx from being finished off by an <a href=\"\/antlion\/3015-252\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-252\">Ant-Lion<\/a>. After assessing Alyx\u2019s wounds, the Vort tells Gordon that it will not be easy to save her and that they will require the Ant-Lion\u2019s larval extract, as it possesses powerful healing qualities. Gordon and the Vort travel deep into the Ant-Lions\u2019 hive and steal the larval extract. Meanwhile, other Vortigaunts are keeping Alyx\u2019s state stable back in an abandoned silo. Upon returning to Alyx with the extract, Gordon is told that the Vortigaunts must weave Gordon and Alyx's life forces, effectively intertwining their fates.<\/p><p style=\"\">Just before Alyx\u2019s wounds are healed, the <a href=\"\/g-man\/3005-421\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-421\">G-Man<\/a> appears for the first time since the beginning of <a href=\"\/half-life-2-episode-one\/3030-14328\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14328\">Episode 1<\/a>.

The G-Man explains that Alyx would not even be alive today had he not saved her from Black Mesa and, as a form of repayment for keeping her alive, he charges Gordon with the duty of safely delivering her to White Forest. The G-Man then plants a hypnotic suggestion in Alyx\u2019s mind instructing her to relay the message \u201cprepare for unforeseen consequences\u201d to her father.<\/p><p style=\"\">After the G-Man\u2019s cryptic visit, Alyx awakens fully healed but still in pain. Gordon and a Vortigaunt companion assist her into an elevator and the trio sets off to find a car. Eventually, Alyx fully recovers and the group finds a car, giving Gordon and Alyx an opportunity to quickly head to White Forest. Gordon and Alyx encounter several obstacles on the way to White Forest, but after staving off several ambushes by Combine soldiers, hunters, and a Hunter Chopper, they finally make it to the base. There, they are warmly greeted by Eli and Dr. Kleiner. The reunion is cut short when a Combine raiding party breaches security and makes it into the base. Gordon eliminates the threat by defeating most of the enemies and sealing the silo doors to prevent further Combine invasion.<\/p><h3>Mutual Friend<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-293831\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-293831\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Dr Kleiner and Eli Vance<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After Gordon reunites with the group, they go to Eli\u2019s work area to watch a transmission from <a href=\"\/judith-mossman\/3005-1092\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1092\">Judith Mossman<\/a> that was recovered along with the data packet in Episode 1. Eli becomes incredibly nervous after seeing that Judith is in danger, and becomes even more rattled upon Dr. Kleiner\u2019s discovery of a hidden message in Judith\u2019s transmission. The message reveals that Judith has discovered The Borealis, a legendary research vessel that infamously disappeared years ago. It is learned that the vessel was owned by <a href=\"\/black-mesa\/3035-64\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-64\">Black Mesa<\/a> competitor, <a href=\"\/aperture-science-enrichment-center\/3035-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-94\">Aperture Science<\/a>. Kleiner and Eli have a heated debate about what should be done with the vessel. Eli is convinced that The Borealis can only bring more harm to earth and must be destroyed, while Kleiner urges that knowledge gained from The Borealis could help the humans finish off Combine forces on earth.<\/p><p style=\"\">The argument is left unfinished, and Kleiner leaves to prepare for the firing of the rocket that is to be used to shut down the City 17 portal. Shortly after Kleiner has left, the G-Man triggers the hypnotic cue in Alyx\u2019s mind. Consequently, Alyx walks up to her father and says, \u201cDad, prepare for unforeseen consequences.\u201d Eli nearly collapses upon hearing this, and Alyx comes back out of her trance with no memory of what she just said. Eli assures her that he is alright and that he would just like a cup of tea. Alyx agrees to go make it, leaving Gordon and Eli alone in the work room.<\/p><p style=\"\">With Alyx out of earshot, Eli confides in Gordon the importance of the line \u201cprepare for unforeseen consequences.\u201d According to Eli, that is exactly what the G-Man had told him just before the <a href=\"\/resonance-cascade\/3015-66\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-66\">resonance cascade<\/a> at <a href=\"\/black-mesa-research-facility\/3035-64\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-64\">Black Mesa<\/a> was triggered.

Immediately after this Dr. Magnusson barges in with news of an incoming Combine assault. He informs Eli and Gordon that several Dropships carrying Striders were spotted heading towards White Forest and he volunteers Gordon for the job of taking them out. Gordon silently agrees and heads out with Magnusson where he is introduced to a new weapon named \u201c <a href=\"\/magnusson-device\/3055-1434\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1434\">The Magnusson Device<\/a>\u201d, a weapon for taking out Striders that Dr. Magnusson assures Gordon was named by the staff.<\/p><p style=\"\">The weapon works by being launched onto the body of a Strider via gravity gun, after Gordon sticks a Strider with the device it can then be detonated by gunfire causing the Strider to spectacularly explode.

Excited cheers and shouts of praise for Freeman flood the field and PA system. Alyx is waiting back inside for Gordon who is amazed at his performance against the Striders. They take a lift back up to the rocket control room and on the way even Magnusson feels compelled to thank Gordon. Everyone at the base agrees that Gordon should be the one who launches the rocket and so he presses the button launching the salvation of humanity into the super portal and destroying the last chance the Combine had at retaking Earth.<\/p><h3>Endgame<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223649\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223649\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Striders and hunters attacking the base<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game concludes with Alyx and Gordon preparing to take off in a helicopter that Alyx fixed up.

As Eli is saying goodbye a Combine <a href=\"\/advisor\/3015-231\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-231\">Advisor<\/a> crashes through the glass roof and pins Gordon and Alyx against the wall. The Advisor slowly floats over to a knocked over Eli just as another Advisor enters and keeps Gordon and Alyx completely immobile. Eli tries fruitlessly to hurt the Advisor with a pipe but the Advisor shrugs it off and picks up Eli in his mechanical arms. Eli is turned towards Gordon and Alyx as he is raised up to the Advisors extending tongue, he tells Alyx to close her eyes as she screams in horror for her Father\u2019s life. Eli\u2019s last wish is that Gordon destroys <a href=\"\/borealis\/3055-363\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-363\">The Borealis<\/a> and his last words to Alyx are \u201cI love you baby\u201d. The Advisor brutally punctures the back of Eli\u2019s head with his proboscis like tongue and appears to suck out his brain. Just as The Advisor is about to do the same to Gordon, <a href=\"\/dog\/3005-737\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-737\">Dog<\/a> comes barreling through the glass and tackles the Advisor injuring him in the process. The Advisor scuttles away in pain and the other follows as they both float up and take off as fast as possible. Gordon lies on the floor now watching as Alyx sobs over Eli\u2019s dead body, the screen fades to black as Alyx cries the final words of the game: \u201cdon\u2019t leave me\u201d.<\/p><h2>G-Man Sightings<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5141\/318125-ep2outland11b0001pq0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-318125\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5141\/318125-ep2outland11b0001pq0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-318125\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/5141\/318125-ep2outland11b0001pq0.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The G-Man appears on the monitors in the background<\/figcaption><\/figure><ol><li>The G-Man's \"heart to heart' with Gordon during a cut scene just before Alyx's healing.<\/li><li>He walks slowly across a large bridge in the area where Gordon must retrieve the car.<\/li><li>Entering the White Forest Inn, just before you arrive in the car and are blocked off by the Combine<\/li><li>His silhouette appears momentarily on the big screen TV in Eli's office just before Alyx's line.<\/li><\/ol><h2>Levels<\/h2><p style=\"\">7 new levels were added to the <a href=\"\/\">Half-Life 2<\/a>'s universe in this second expansion.<\/p><ul><li><b>To the White Forest<\/b><\/li><li><b>This Vortal Coil<\/b><\/li><li><b>Freeman Pontifex<\/b><\/li><li><b>Riding Shotgun<\/b><\/li><li><b>Under the Radar<\/b><\/li><li><b>Our Mutual Fiend<\/b><\/li><li><b>T-Minus One<\/b><\/li><\/ul><h2><b>System Requirements<\/b><\/h2><p style=\"\"><strong>PC System Requirements<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Minimum:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>1.7 GHz Processor<\/li><li>512MB RAM<\/li><li>DirectX\u00ae 8.1 level Graphics Card (Requires support for SSE)<\/li><li>Windows\u00ae 7 (32\/64-bit)\/Vista\/XP<\/li><li>Mouse<\/li><li>Keyboard<\/li><li>Internet Connection<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Recommended:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>Pentium 4 processor (3.0GHz, or better)<\/li><li>1GB RAM<\/li><li>DirectX\u00ae 9 level Graphics Card<\/li><li>Windows\u00ae 7 (32\/64-bit)\/Vista\/XP<\/li><li>Mouse<\/li><li>Keyboard<\/li><li>Internet Connection<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Mac System Requirements<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Minimum:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>OS X version Leopard 10.5.8<\/li><li>Snow Leopard 10.6.3<\/li><li>1GB RAM<\/li><li>NVIDIA GeForce 8 or higher, ATI X1600 or higher or Intel HD 3000 or higher<\/li><li>Mouse<\/li><li>Keyboard<\/li><li>Internet Connection<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/2489842-box_hl2e2.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/2489842-box_hl2e2.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/2489842-box_hl2e2.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2489842-box_hl2e2.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/2489842-box_hl2e2.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/2489842-box_hl2e2.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/2489842-box_hl2e2.png"},"name":"Half-Life 2: Episode Two"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga is a fusion of Lego Star Wars I and II.

The game has all the features of the first two games, however, there are also some new features added such as co-op, and customisable characters. The Complete Saga edition of the game contains more characters than Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy had, like Indiana Jones. It also included an online co-op mode and new challenges.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Lego games franchise is fast becoming famous for it's easy to play, fun for all the family style. The gameplay consists mostly of platforming and action sequences, but it is broken up by puzzle solving sections. None of these areas are particularly challenging as the game is designed for family play. All six episodes in the Star Wars saga are represented in the game and are broken up into six levels each. Death holds no real consequence as your character merely breaks into pieces, only to be reformed instantly, with no loss of life. However, when you die, you lose studs, and this can be a detriment to your progress toward the \"True Jedi\" status meter filling up.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are also several unlockables to be gained by collecting <a href=\"\/lego-stud\/3055-2481\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2481\" data-mce-href=\"\/lego-stud\/3055-2481\/\">studs<\/a> (currency in the Lego Star Wars universe), which can be used to by characters, hints, cheats and many other things. \"The Complete Saga\" also contains deleted levels from previous Star Wars games and a \"duel mode\" which were not featured in previous games either.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is also a massive number of 162 playable characters available in the game which can be unlocked by playing through the story mode or purchased. These characters range from all of the 6 Episodes, from <a href=\"\/yoda\/3005-7\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7\" data-mce-href=\"\/yoda\/3005-7\/\">Yoda<\/a> to <a href=\"\/jar-jar-binks\/3005-2394\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2394\" data-mce-href=\"\/jar-jar-binks\/3005-2394\/\">Jar-Jar Binks<\/a>, and even <a href=\"\/indiana-jones\/3005-1424\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1424\" data-mce-href=\"\/indiana-jones\/3005-1424\/\">Indiana Jones<\/a>. Any of these characters can be played in Free Mode and you can effortlessly cycle through a limited amount of other characters in-game to reach places that you couldn't in story mode. There is also a character creator function in the game, which lets you create your own character from any mix of the existing characters' parts.<\/p><p style=\"\">Each level has intriguingly-placed doors which can only be opened on a second playthrough on the \"free roam\" option by characters that you unlock later in the game, so each level must be done at least two or three times. This adds to Lego Star Wars' already large replay value.<\/p><h2>Co-op Play<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17537\/859451-lego_star_wars_the_video_game_20050401035243963.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-859451\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17537\/859451-lego_star_wars_the_video_game_20050401035243963.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-859451\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1\/17537\/859451-lego_star_wars_the_video_game_20050401035243963.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>A game for young and old alike.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">A huge part of the gaming experience of Lego Star Wars is its co-op play. At all times throughout the game there will be two characters on screen. If played as a one player game, the second character is AI controlled, but a second player can replace the AI at any moment. The second player simply has to press the start button and can drop out of the game at any time.Whilst the co-op feature isn't needed for the combat sections, many of the platforming and puzzle solving sections require co-operative thought to complete them. \"The Complete Saga\" introduced an online co-op mode which was not featured in the previous games.<\/p><h2>Replay Value<\/h2><p style=\"\">One of the main assets of the Lego Star Wars games are their replay value, and \"The Complete Saga\" has by far the most. Players are given a lot of reasons to play through the levels again, like hidden areas, red bricks, gold bricks, and minikits. Also when you collect enough studs on the level you fill up a meter and you get \"True Jedi\" status. The different characters that you unlock throughout the game can be used to overcome specific obstacles in the level when you replay.<\/p><h2>Collectables<\/h2><ul><li>Minikits: There are 10 minikits on every level in the game, when all ten are collected they form a lego version of a specific vehicle from the Star Wars saga. These vehicles are then unlocked as playable in the vehicle missions. Finding all ten also earns the player 50,000 studs and a gold brick.<\/li><li>Red Bricks: There is one red brick on every level of the game. Once found they unlock a cheat that can be purchased from the shop in the cantina.<\/li><li>Gold Bricks: These are the reward for completing objectives in the game. There are 160 in total. They are gained in a variety of ways; finishing a level, acheiving \"true jedi\" status, challenges, minikits, and they can also be bought from the shop in the cantina.<\/li><li>\"True Jedi Status\": This is earned when the player finds a certain number of studs on a given level. The amount needed to gain the status varies from level to level.<\/li><li>Challenge Minkits: Much like the regular minikits, there are 10 hidden challenge minikits on every level. To get these minikits the player must choose \"challenge\" mode; the aim of this mode is to collect all 10 minikits before 10 minutes has passed. They are hidden in different locations to the regular minikits, are blue in colour, and are not required to get all 160 gold bricks. 50,000 studs is the reward.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Characters<\/h2><p

Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is a <a href=\"\/remake\/3015-340\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-340\">remake<\/a> of the critically-acclaimed Xbox game <a

href=\"\/starbreeze-studios-ab\/3010-1768\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1768\">Starbreeze Studios<\/a>. The game features the entire <a href=\"\/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay\/3030-11085\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11085\">Escape From Butcher Bay<\/a> campaign(which has been improved from the original <a href=\"\/xbox\/3045-32\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox<\/a> version), which can be selected when starting a new game. It isn't required to play through the <a href=\"\/butcher-bay\/3035-577\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-577\">Butcher Bay<\/a> portion of the game in order to access the new campaign, Dark Athena.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game puts you in the shoes of Riddick, a deadly fugitive who is wanted by every prison and every bounty hunter in the galaxy. The only problem is keeping him locked up. Butcher Bay and it's expansion Dark Athena take you through the seedy world of the Butcher Bay jail, aboard the merc ship <a href=\"\/dark-athena\/3035-2362\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2362\">Dark Athena<\/a> and across the world of Aguerra where you'll hack, slash and snap the necks of every no good in-mate, guard and solider who gets in your way of freedom. The game is a mixture of stealth, shooter and melee combat.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/961514-fs_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-961514\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/961514-fs_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-961514\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/961514-fs_17.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Melee attack.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is similar to it's predecessor, although some notable changes have been made. One of the most important differences is removing the DNA restricted weapons . Though early on in the Dark Athena campaign the player must rely on <a href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee<\/a> or picking up guns attached to the clone enemies.Then, at a certain point weapons can then be picked up and used unlike the first game which required a DNA input.<\/p><p style=\"\">The weaponry list (both <a href=\"\/projectile\/3015-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3\">projectile<\/a> and <a href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee<\/a>) has also expanded and the player has access to a significantly more sophisticated arsenal . Assault on Dark Athena is somewhat less linear than Escape From Butcher Bay. Though the game includes much more shooting action than Butcher Bay which had a more significant amount of <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><h3>Team Deathmatch<\/h3><p style=\"\">This a standard <a href=\"\/team-deathmatch\/3015-2463\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">Team Deathmatch<\/a><\/p><h3>Pitch Black<\/h3><p style=\"\">Named after the first movie featuring Richard Riddick, this mode is similar to the 'Juggernaut' mode in the <a href=\"\/halo\/3025-2\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">Halo series<\/a>. In this mode, the map has very little light, most of the players are guards while one is Riddick. Guards are equipped with guns and <a href=\"\/flashlight\/3055-156\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlights<\/a> of limited effectiveness, while Riddick is armed with his Ulak blades and can use his Eyeshine ability. Guards must work together to take Riddick down, while he attempts to kill as many guards as he can. If a guard kills Riddick, he immediately respawns <i>as<\/i> Riddick.<\/p><h3>Arena<\/h3><p style=\"\">Arena is a one-on-one or two-on-two elimination matches inside a small, contained map, with the other players spectating until it's their turn to throw down.<\/p><h3>Butcher Bay Riot<\/h3><p style=\"\">Similar to <a href=\"\/counter-strike\/3025-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-114\">Counter-Strike<\/a> in that you have a currency at the start of the game to buy weapons, armor and ammo. However the main game is a 3 way fight between Prisoners, Mercenaries and Guards. There is one power-node in the middle the objective is to get the node into your opponents base and each team will have a certain team's base they have to get the node into, for example, Prisoners will have to get the node into the Guards' base the Guards will be after the Mercenaries and the Mercenaries will be after the Prisoners.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>The developer team has claimed that Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is a profoundly long story-driven <a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first person<\/a> shooter. Finishing the single player campaign can take somewhere around 20-25 hours.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The world of Dark Athena is deliberately rude and provocative . Due to <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a> nature of the game player can witness or hear assorted things ranging from overhearing conversations on soldier's sexual habits to finding pornography lying around, to supposedly interrupting masturbating guards. The game also features strong language and profanity.

Mason makes it inside the Terraformer but is too late to stop the Terraformer from being destroyed, Hale disguising himself as a wounded soldier and getting away right under Mason's nose. The Terraformer now being destroyed, humanity is forced underground into old mining caverns. Mason is forced to live with the guilt that humanity's exile is his fault.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/30\/1799248-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.38.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799248\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/30\/1799248-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.38.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799248\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/30\/1799248-screen_shot_2011_06_01_at_5.38.55_pm.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Mason<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The story skips several years and Mason has now reconverted himself into a smuggler with love interest Kara in the underground city of Bastion. Despite Kara's warnings, Mason takes a mining job where he destroys an old Marauder seal. Before he can realize what he's done, his employers reveal themselves to be cultists under Hale and Mason is left for dead. He awakes three days later and realizes that he's unleashed a force of dormant native Martians on the planet. Unwilling to let the Martians take the planet that is rightfully theirs back from the invading Humans, Mason races back to Bastion only to realize that it's been devastated by the Martians. He helps the surviving Humans set up camp and get them clean water but they end up accusing Mason of releasing the Martians and start chasing him down. Mason escapes and meets up with Kara. The two have no other choice but to go to the surface and hunt down Hale.<\/p><p style=\"\">After a brief meet and greet with the Red Faction, Kara and Mason find Hale. Hale is attempting to use the Martians to rule Mars but it is evident that he has little to no control over them. After a chase in the mines, Mason kills the dastardly cult leader and manages to hightail it before the rest of the cultists kill him. The death of Hale however does not solve the Martian problem. Darius and Kara decide to go pay a visit to an old Marauder oracle to see how they can stop the invasion.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon arrival, the oracle is dead but has left a data key that Darius' navigation system (S.A.M.) decrypts. All the Martians are being controlled by the queen, buried deep in a marauder temple. Darius and Kara make it into the temple and after crashing their vehicle, the two share a kiss confiding their feelings to each other. But just as this happens, the Martians attack and Kara is killed by a tentacle before being dragged down into a pit and eaten by the aliens. Devastated, Hale promises to make the Martians pay, and after committing unjust Martian genocide, he makes it to the Martian queen. After giving the queen a good beating, she flees to the surface. S.A.M. indicates that all the Martians would die due to the unnatural presence of oxygen in the Martian atmosphere, so Mason somehow fixes the Terraformer, rendering Mars as it was before Hale returned it to its natural state. The game ends with Mason, destroyer of worlds and murderer of species, looking at a ray of sun coming through the clouds that should not be there.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Red Faction: Armageddon is a third person shooter. Much like other games in the genre, you run around the environment, taking on multiple enemies at once with a wide array of weapons while taking cover behind objects to let your health replenish (it must be noted however that there is no cover system). Armageddon stands out ever so slightly by including minor destructible environments, though nothing to the extent of its superior predecessor Guerrilla. All of the destruction is done with the game's weapons, which range from sledgehammers to rocket launchers, all perfect for sending two story buildings crashing down onto Martian defenders. And if ever you run out of ammo, you can always use the Maul, a giant gravity hammer. Shooting in the game centers on locking on your opponent, meaning that precise aiming is not necessary. Weapon selection is done thanks to weapon lockers, scattered throughout the game world (some of which have to be rebuilt). You can only carry for weapons with you at a time and ammo is mostly replenished through ammo crates since the aliens don't drop any ammo. Ammo crates range from small cubical crates that only replenish ammo for one gun or large rectangular crates that replenish all weapons. The game keeps you from getting stuck in a location by featuring a powerful melee attack that you always have that can break down doors and walls.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79498\/1751152-red_faction_armageddon_descent_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1751152\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/79498\/1751152-red_faction_armageddon_descent_gameplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1751152\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/79498\/1751152-red_faction_armageddon_descent_gameplay.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Some Inferno GX Action<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><i>Armageddon<\/i> mixes third person shooting with rare on rails segments where you take control of a heavy machine gun (there's only one segment like this in the entire game). It also has you riding in the EXO Walker, a mech suit that's equipped with both rockets and machine guns. The mech suit also comes equipped with a powerful dash and has infinite ammo. Unlike Mason, the mech has two layers of health: a shield that replenishes and a health bar that does not. The game also lets you pilot the Inferno GX, a gunship that fires missiles and bullets. You control both the vertical and horizontal movement of the ship and fire lock on missiles that rarely miss.<\/p><p style=\"\">When on foot, you can not only destroy but also rebuild thanks to the nano forge. The nano forge is an important part of the game since it lets Darius purchase upgrades thanks to salvage that is both found on the ground and by killing enemies. Once you have enough salvage, you can purchase upgrades at upgrade stations scattered throughout the levels (these stations are blue while weapon stations are red). There are four rings of upgrades that you can purchase from. Every upgrade on the first three rings cost 1000 pieces of salvage while each upgrade on the fourth and last ring cost 1500. Some upgrades contain prerequisites such as having to purchase a previous upgrade. Upgrades give Darius special abilities such as the ability to put enemies into stasis while other upgrades improve his health as well as his weapons. Special abilities can only be used every so often, as indicated by a progress bar on the lower left side of your reticule.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Nano Forge<\/h2><h3>Weapons<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor

Extermination. It's a mode similar to Horde in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20662\" href=\"\/gears-of-war-2\/3030-20662\/\"> Gears of War 2<\/a> where four players must co-operate against wave after wave of aliens. There are a total of 15 different maps comprised of 30 waves. Of the 15, five are locked but they can be played if the host has unlocked them. Objectives vary from map to map. One will require you to simply kill all aliens to proceed while others will also have you defending certain buildings or generators. TThe game tells you how many \"troops\" are left to kill in the top right corner of the screen.<\/p><p style=\"\">The upgrades that you've purchased in the singleplayer do not transfer to the multiplayer. Instead, you unlock new abilities as you complete waves. You also unlock new weapons as the waves go on. Unlike in the singlepayer, you can only carry one special ability that upgrades itself wave after wave. Players have lives, the number of lives depending o,n how many players are in a match. You lose a life each time you are downed. Each time you find yourself on the ground, a partner will have to come and heal you within 25 seconds or else you are permanently eliminated. Each wave you complete carries you to the next and you can replay specific waves.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is one final \"multiplayer\" mode called Ruin. This can not strictly be called as multiplayer since your not playing with other people. Instead, Ruin is a score attack mode where you try to create as much chaos as possible and then compare your score with the rest of the Red Faction community. You begin each infestation map by selecting four weapons. Once that is done, you'll have little over a minute to blow everything up and build your multiplier. Your multiplier rises when you cause different acts of destruction at the same time (for example if you manage to topple a building which explodes a gas canister). Once the timer stops, you are immobilized but the game gives you an extra 10 seconds to see if anything that you have damaged may suddenly topple and earn you points. To unlock more Ruin maps, you much beat a par score for each map. It must be noted that Ruin is only available for people who buy the game new. A code to download a key to unlock the mode is on the back of the instruction manuel and if you do not have it, you can or choose to purchase it or play a demo of it which consists of one map.<\/p><h2>Sales<\/h2><p style=\"\"><i>Red Faction: Armageddon<\/i> sold exceptionally poorly, not managing to break into the top 10 of sales on the week of its release. This is not due to the strength of the <i>Red Faction<\/i> franchise in general, but because the developers ignored the phenomenal success of the previous entry, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21125\" href=\"\/red-faction-guerrilla\/3030-21125\/\"> <i>Guerrilla<\/i><\/a>, and chose not to follow up on its winning combination of open-world gameplay and utter destruction.

It also features realistic car damage modeling, and is frequently described as a combination of <a href=\"\/mario-kart\/3025-507\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-507\">Mario Kart<\/a> and an arcade racer. It could be most easily related to the racing game <a href=\"\/wipeout\/3025-205\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-205\">Wipeout<\/a> than more simulation heavy racers like <a href=\"\/forza-motorsport-3\/3030-24995\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24995\">Forza<\/a>. Unlike many of the games that currently feature power-ups, Blur relies strongly on it's realistic physics model and Bizarre's Ben Ward has stated, \"Blur isn't about the power-ups, it's about your ability to drive with power-ups augmenting that\".<\/p><p style=\"\">The game moves away from the clinical and precise nature of sim-like racers that force the player to work within strict time limits and perform inch-perfect turns. It moves towards a more arcade experience that will reward experimentation. Progress through the game is influenced by 'Fan Points', a new version of <a href=\"\/project-gotham-racing\/3025-430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-430\">Project Gotham<\/a>'s Kudos system, awarded after each race for good racing and use of powerups. You can also get mid-race challenges from your fans to complete for bonus fans. There are also car specific challenges that can be completed to attain upgrades for that car. The idea is that the more skilled you are, the more fans you attain and the more money they donate to you, allowing you can upgrade your car further and move onto other circuits.<\/p><p style=\"\">Blur is designed to tie closely with the game's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blurgame.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website<\/a>, and integrates with popular social networking sites Facebook, and Twitter to allow you to post race results as soon as they are completed. The website also has a stats page integrated within the site to allow players to link their accounts. A leaderboards are available for the website as well. It's menu and hub system is a fictional social networking site, where players and NPC drivers communicate with each other to organize the street races and progress the story.<\/p><p style=\"\">Now with Activision disbanding Bizarre Creations, it is safe to assume that the website will not be completed. The leaderboards for one were never finished along with the 'community' tab. It is also safe to assume there will be no updates for the game either.<\/p><h2>Modes<\/h2><h3>Single Player<\/h3><p style=\"\">Within the single player campaign the goal for the player is to achieve \"Lights\". These lights are awarded after each race and based on your performance\/finishing place, fan target and fan run. In each race you can earn lights by coming in 1st, 2nd or 3rd (1st = 5 lights, 2nd = 4 lights and 3rd = 3 lights) with one additional light each for meeting the fan target and completing the fan run. You'll also need to complete certain challenges to receive Lights, such as knocking a set amount of opponents off of a bridge into the water. These Lights are needed to eventually \"duel\" the boss character for that location, where assuming you win you will receive a special version of a vehicle.<\/p><h3>Multiplayer<\/h3><p style=\"\">In multiplayer, the same or similar networking system is used to create races and groups with particular settings. The game features 4 player split-screen multiplayer locally, and ive online multi player modes wherein up to 20 players can participate. The five multi player modes are <b>Motor Mash<\/b> (2-20 players) with the goal of simply damaging other players' cars, <b>Skirmish<\/b> (2-10 players) which is a tradition race mode, and <b>Powered-up<\/b> (2-20 players) which is another traditional race mode. Other online multi player modes present are <b>Super Car Racing<\/b> (2-20 players) -- a race mode wherein only Class A cars are allowed, <b>Team Racing<\/b> (2-20 players) where two teams of players battle it out for first place, and there is also <b>World Tour<\/b> that is essentially the 'quick play' mode who want to get into a race as quick as possible. A special playlist is also present that served the purpose of allowing the developers to upload custom game types and playlists, though this was never taken advantage of.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Locations and Tracks<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63747\/1295234-blur_screenshot_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295234\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/63747\/1295234-blur_screenshot_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295234\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/6\/63747\/1295234-blur_screenshot_04.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Race taking place in the Amboy<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Races take place in 4 countries, with over 15 locations which take place at night or dusk through 'remixed' versions of cities such as London, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Barcelona. Many of these locations are the same as those featured in the Project Gotham games. However unlike PGR which showed some of the most recognizable tourist spots and landmarks, Blur takes players to much grittier locations to suit the pace and feel of the game. Each track features alternative routes and shortcuts. The locations are not all one to one with the real places that the tracks are located. To create the best racing experience the developers of Blur have altered some of the locations from satellite, aerial, and on site photos. One example is San Francisco, where the developers changed the shoreline to create a fast paced race.<\/p><h2>Power-ups<\/h2><p style=\"\">Blur features vehicular combat using power-ups collected along the race track. You can hold more than one power-up at once--up to five depending on purchased upgrades--and they can be cycled using the shoulder buttons. It is possible to stack the same power-ups to use in quick succession, and they can be dropped back onto the track at any time.<\/p><p style=\"\">*<i>Note: The weapon descriptions refer to the standard weapons' behavior before Mods are applied.<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>Power-up<\/th><th>Behavior<\/th><th>Range<\/th><th>Associated Mods<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/108431\/1663309-mine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1663309\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/108431\/1663309-mine.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1663309\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/10\/108431\/1663309-mine.png\"><\/a><\/figure><\/td><td>The <b>Mine <\/b>power-up can be dropped behind the racer, or shot as a projectile for a short distance in front of the racer.

You start with a small selection and unlock more as you progress through the game. The different classes of vehicles are D, C, B, A and Off-Road, with D being the lower quality vehicles, A being the supercars and Off-Road vehicles specializing on off-road tracks. There are also different driving categories of vehicles. These include Very Grippy, Grippy, Balanced, Drifty and Very Drifty. The \"Grippy\" cars are very good at taking corners, but are very hard to drift. While \"Drifty\" cars are very good at drifting, but much easier to lose control of your vehicle. These different categories are meant to separate the good drivers from the great drivers. This is because you need to have excellent control over the drifty cars and in order to be successful on all tracks one must be efficient with a variety of vehicles.<\/p><p style=\"\">When you complete One-on-One races you will can that \"Bosses\" car. These cars can then be used in multiplayer as long as you have reached the proper level and unlocked the stock model in multiplayer. These Boss cars are already fully upgraded so they have an advantage over the stock models.<\/p><h3>Vehicle List<\/h3><p style=\"\">*Note* This chart does not contain the Legendary Vehicles<\/p><p

game features 50 multiplayer ranks, 10 Legend ranks and 25 single player ranks. The Legend ranks can be achieved once you reach level 50. This will cause your rank to be reset to 1, but in return you will receive a legend car and a legend rank. In order for the player to progress through the levels they need to achieve fans. Fans can be achieved in several different ways, such as completing the 50 challenges in the game or performing well in the race (drifting, hitting opponents with power-ups and your final placing). The number of fans you achieve can be increased by using certain modifications in your load-outs.<\/p><h3>Challenges<\/h3><h4>Drivers Ed<\/h4><p style=\"\">Most basic challenges<\/p><ul><li>Airbrake III -

One player can win multiple awards, and also note that the awards are present for simple amusement -- winning a post-race award does not amount to the player receiving extra Fans.

Players must kill all Zeds in a wave, and after that, get a period of time to rest and rearm. They will fight through a set number of waves, culminating in a boss wave where players pit their wits against the game's boss, the <a href=\"\/patriarch\/3005-19367\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19367\">Patriarch<\/a>. Most of the maps are set in Great Britain, and the cast of characters all hail from the Isles, featuring many stereotypical accents and slang.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are 5 levels of difficulty in Killing Floor: Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, and Hell on Earth. Each level, and the number players in the team, increases Zed hitpoints, damage, and number spawned per wave. There are also 3 game lengths, Short with 4 waves, Medium with 7 waves, and Long with 10 waves. Most servers run Long games.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2891\/1066863-killingfloor_280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1066863\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2891\/1066863-killingfloor_280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1066863\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/2891\/1066863-killingfloor_280.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Game Over<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">After every wave, players get a chance to buy new weapons and equipment at the Trader. The Trader is spread out in specific spots in a map, and is open only during the rest period. Players must make their way to her within the rest time allocated, or they will have to fight the next wave with their current equipment and ammunition. She accepts British Pounds (\u00a3) as currency, which are rewarded to a player for killing Zeds and surviving a wave. Players can also trade cash with each other, which allows newcomers to get equipped with the necessary equipment to survive the next wave.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players can heal themselves, and each other, with their equipped Medical Syringes. These syringes are available for every player, but is limited to the amount of charge they have. Each heal takes up 50 charge, but self-heals take up 100 charge, emptying the syringe. The charges will replenish over time, and the recharge rate is increased with the Field Medic perk.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2891\/1066859-killingfloor_276.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1066859\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2891\/1066859-killingfloor_276.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1066859\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/2891\/1066859-killingfloor_276.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Welding<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Players can dictate the movement of Zeds by shutting off passageways and doors. They can also weld doors to slow down Zed movement, as they will now have to break down those doors before passing through. Welders are available to all players, and Support Specialists gain welding bonuses in their perk.<\/p><p style=\"\">A special feature called \"Zed Time\" is triggered when players perform gory kills, such as headshots. Zed Time slows down time for all players, even in multiplayer, for a period of time. The Commando and Berserker perks can increase this bonus time by killing additional Zeds while in Zed Time.<\/p><h2>Perks<\/h2><p style=\"\">Perks are upgradable <a href=\"\/classes\/3015-405\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-405\">player classes<\/a> that each player chooses when they enter the game, granting them special bonuses tied to a particular playstyle (for example, Firebugs excel at fire-based weaponry while Field Medics excel at healing). In-between waves, players have the option to switch to another class (but only once per wave). By performing specific tasks (no matter what Perk they choose), players can gain experience and level up their Perks (to a maximum of six levels), providing additional bonuses.<\/p><h3>Field Medic<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/1474104-kfperk1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1474104\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/1474104-kfperk1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1474104\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/8\/87790\/1474104-kfperk1.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Field Medic<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Field Medic specializes in healing injured players.

It does not have any special abilities, nor does it deal much damage, but it can grab players and keep them from moving. This allows more dangerous Zeds to approach distracted players.<\/p><p style=\"\">Clots are clones of Kevin Clamely's deceased son, with genetic alterations to make it tougher than normal humans.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Bloat<\/h3><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"\/bloat\/3015-7077\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7077\">Bloat<\/a> has a lot of hitpoints, and spews corrosive vomit on players that stray too near to it. When killed, it will explode, spraying it's vomit around its corpse. The Bloat's vomit can affect surrounding Zeds, and good players can force it to spew vomit on tougher Zeds, transferring <a href=\"\/aggro\/3015-105\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-105\">aggro<\/a> to the Bloat.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Gorefast<\/h3><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"\/gorefast\/3015-7078\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7078\">Gorefast<\/a>, like its name suggests, is a fast moving Zed that wields a long blade grafted on it's left arm.

It will lock onto a player, and shoot them with great accuracy after charging for a short time. It is possible to dodge a Husk's shot as it has a slow travel time and the Husk's moving target compensation can be tricked with proper timing. A high level Firebug is entirely immune to damage the Husk's shots, though the force of the blow will still be felt and the Husk's melee attack will still do damage.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Husk was not found in the original mod, although models of a similar Zed was found in the files.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Siren<\/h3><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"\/siren\/3015-7083\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7083\">Siren<\/a> is a ranged Zed that inflicts damage with her voice. When a Siren comes within range of a player, it will starting screaming, affecting all in a small radius around her. Her voice will also distort a player's vision, and will go through armor to damage a player's hitpoints directly. A grenade thrown at a screaming Siren will simply disintegrate, damaging no one. It is possible to damage a Siren with grenades if all players are far enough away that the Siren's aggro would not cause it to scream.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Siren is a clone of Kevin Clamely's wife, who wanted to be a singer but lacked talent.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Scrake<\/h3><p style=\"\">The <a href=\"\/scrake\/3015-7084\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7084\">Scrake<\/a> is a dangerous Zed that wields a chainsaw in place of its right arm.

It moves faster than other Zeds, and can become enraged when it takes a certain amount of damage without attempting to strike a player (This meaning that a player can resent the Fleshpound's rage buildup by inciting it to strike the player) or sees a player continuously for some time. When enraged, it will chase down a player and strike them once with their powerful arms.

Although its damage output is overall weak, it is cheap to refill, has decent magazine size, has little recoil, and is good with headshots against weaker enemies. Alternate Fire toggles a built-in flashlight, which has a rechargable battery (that turns off automatically after some time). A 9mm Pistol is starting equipment for all players and cannot be dropped manually or sold. Players can pick up another 9mm Pistol (either dropped by dead teammates, spawned randomly on maps, or bought from the Trader) to dual-wield (sacrificing accuracy for double magazine size).

Grenades thrown by Firebugs (at ranks 3-6) inflict enemies on fire (dealing slightly less damage), while grenades thrown by Field Medics (after the Hillbilly Horror Halloween Event) create a temporary green smoke cloud that heal all allies in the blast radius (while keeping enemies away, dealing slightly less damage in the initial blast).

The <a href=\"\/4-player-co-op\/3015-2563\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2563\">four-player game<\/a> proceeds in waves and is a split between Trench combat and some <a href=\"\/tower-defense\/3015-413\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-413\">tower-defense<\/a>-like <a href=\"\/turret\/3055-43\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-43\">turret<\/a> placement. Turrets and other objects can be placed around the map and upgraded. Players spend scrap -- broken TVs that pop out of enemies when they're defeated -- to build additional turrets. The game was developed using a version of the same technology behind <a href=\"\/brutal-legend\/3030-20700\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20700\"><i>Br\u00fctal Legend<\/i><\/a> and was published by <a href=\"\/microsoft-studios\/3010-340\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft<\/a> in the United States on June 22, 2011.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Gameplay in <i>Iron Brigade<\/i> consists of two primary activities. The first is building and maintaining defence structures to protect the base, as in a tower defence game. The second is actively combating enemy waves by taking direct control of a Trench and fending them off. Effective gameplay requires both elements be used in tandem, with defensive turrets placed in positions to assist the players as they fight off the encroaching enemies. A matchmaking system which supports public, friend, and party play allows for up to four players to cooperatively play the game's missions with each other online.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are fifteen levels which are evenly distributed between Europe, Africa, and the Pacific, each composed of four missions followed by a boss fight.<\/p><p style=\"\">As players progress, they gain levels and earn items on the battlefield. Money earned from missions and by completing challenges can be spent in the store. Items can be used to customize the player's Trenches. Players are also able to customize their player characters.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">Two war time codebreakers, <a href=\"..\/..\/frank-woodrof\/94-18291\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frank Woodruff<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/vladamir-framsworth\/94-18290\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vladamir Farnsworth<\/a>, receive an alien transmission-- referred to only as \"the Broadcast.\" The other codebreakers who heard it had their brains fried, but Frank and Vlad gained superintelligence from it. Frank goes on to make robot legs for war time heroes so they can be mobile after the war, while Vlad invents the television years ahead of its proper time, and becomes obsessed with networking the world. He releases robots made of said television tubes to lay cables across the world to network the entire planet.<\/p><p style=\"\">In Europe, Frank discovers that the robots, dubbed Monovisions, have begun destroying everything that lies in the path of the cables they wish to lie, regardless of the cost in Human lives. When all traditional military forces are defeated, Frank expands the scope of his robot legs project to create enormous bipedal war platforms, designed so that each soldier is protected by his own \"mobile trench\". Using these Trenches, Frank leads the battle against the Monovisions, and manages to gain a foothold against the \"tube\" invasion. Gaining back ground, along with new intel, the newly-christened Mobile Trench Brigade pushes onward until they have enough leverage to commence an attack on what seems to be the source of the Broadcast by destroying a Pylon in the northern region. Successfully neutralizing it, a greater truth is revealed upon the discovery of a much larger cable which leads underseas towards Africa, which has now been entirely taken over by the Tubes, while the Brigade was focused on the battle elsewhere.<\/p><p style=\"\">Suspecting that the Pylon in Europe was a product of some greater entity, Frank's outfit follows the cable south to Africa and begins to take back land starting in the desert, beginning with a small-yet-inhabitable oasis. After reclaiming more ground, another attempt at penetrating enemy forces is made by acquiring much more powerful firepower with a ship's cannon, and deploying a <a href=\"\/\">giant bomb<\/a> underground in order to disrupt the Tube infrastructure. Successfully crippling most of the opposition, Vlad's newest behemoth creation lies in wait: a massive worm-like Monovision referred to as the Guardian. Upon taking Farnsworth's desert fortress and defeating the Guardian, a final push is initiated in order to track down Vlad once and for all.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Brigade returns to the Pacific region, where Frank first met Vlad twenty years prior to the current engagement. Frank discovers that Vlad has been searching for the origin of the Broadcast as well, in his obsession of understanding and controlling the Tubes. The Brigade subsequently gathers necessary equipment in the region (some which has been left behind by Vlad), in order to assemble and operate the technology which will help discern Vlad's location. After using the top of a volcano to generate a signal which pinpoints Farnsworth, the Brigade confronts him for a final showdown.<\/p><p style=\"\">Vlad's obsession with the Monovisions and the Broadcast have helped him to assimilate a monstrous alien machine, which he hopes to use to destroy the Brigade, and all others who resist, but it is no match for the quick-witted Trench pilots of the Brigade. After the destruction of this robot, Vlad's corpse is retrieved from inside it; his body has withered away and atrophied from all the time spent exposing himself to the tubes. Frank wonders what fate awaits him, as he reflects on the consequences Vlad had incurred, and notes that while the battle was won, he is not sure the war is over.<\/p><h2>Customization<\/h2><p style=\"\">The player has the ability to fully customize their Mobile Trench unit, from weapons to body types, all the way down to legs. Each Part has different stats that can effect how the player can effect the battle field. A player may want to go full engineer and place lots of turrets or go full force with a Trench capable of 3 weapon slots on each side. Players have many choices when it comes to taking on the Monovisions.<\/p><p style=\"\">The weapon categories the player can choose from include machine guns, shotguns, grenade launchers, sniper cannons, artillery cannons, and broadcasters. Machine guns are ideal for close to medium range combat with many smaller enemies and ones with the flak ability are used against aerial enemies. Shotguns are primarily used in short range situations with fewer, stronger enemies. Grenade launchers are an explosive class used to disperse clustered groups and targets with additional armor. Sniper cannons deal with threats that are farther away or ones that require additional accuracy and high amounts of damage. Artillery cannons are mainly used to take the armor off of breakers but can be used on all enemies somewhat effectively. Finally, broadcasters are used to absolutely destroy enemies up close (excellent against the knobs).<\/p><p style=\"\">The player can buy items in the shop. Or get lucky and get them as drops in the missions.<\/p><h3>Marine Items (Hat)<\/h3><table><tbody><tr><th>Rank<\/th><th>Item Name<\/th><th>Cost<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>PSI

American release, <i>Iron Brigade<\/i> was originally entitled <i>Trenched<\/i>. However, the subsequent release of the game in Europe met with a legal battle regarding trademark conflict.

Due to the way European law works, the trademark also covers basic variants on the title, giving the board game creator the rights to the name \"Trenched\" as well. Various trademark agreements in place between the <a href=\"\/europe\/3035-289\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">European Union<\/a> countries mean that the trademark ownership is extended throughout most of the European region.<\/p><p style=\"\">Microsoft chose to avoid a legal battle by releasing <i>Trenched<\/i> under the name \"<i>Iron Brigade<\/i>\" in Europe. However, due to embarrassing coding issues within Xbox Live, this change to the game made it incompatible for multiplayer games with the North American version, <i>Trenched<\/i>. On September 9th, 2011, <a href=\"\/brad-muir\/3040-98297\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98297\">Brad Muir<\/a> regretfully announced that the game would be renamed <i>Iron Brigade<\/i> across <i>all<\/i> regions. An updated version of the game was later released in North America with the <i>Iron Brigade<\/i> name.<\/p><h2>DLC<\/h2><p style=\"\">The first and last DLC pack for <i>Iron Brigade<\/i>, \"Rise of the Martian Bear,\" includes a <a href=\"\/horde-mode\/3015-3021\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">horde mode<\/a>, as well as new weapons and costumes, some of which are from Double Fine's other downloadable games, <a href=\"\/costume-quest\/3030-32304\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32304\">Costume Quest<\/a> and <a href=\"\/stacking\/3030-33251\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33251\">Stacking<\/a>. Most importantly, it continues the story of <i>Iron Brigade<\/i>, in which it is discovered that Vlad's death triggered a program in which an electronic copy of his mind was downloaded into the brain of his pet bear, who now attempts to rebuild Vlad's Tube empire on the foreign soil of the planet <a href=\"\/mars\/3035-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4\">Mars<\/a>, where it will not be disturbed by pesky Humans until it is too late for them to stop him.

Final Fantasy VIII continues with a number of elements found in previous games in the series; as illustrated by its use of a sophisticated 3D engine, high quality cutscenes, and deep story and characterization. The plot focuses on <a href=\"\/squall-leonhart\/3005-783\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-783\">Squall Leonhart<\/a>, a cadet of <a href=\"\/balamb-garden\/3035-232\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-232\">Balamb Garden<\/a> mercenaries called SeeD. SeeD's involvement with a small resistance group fighting against the oppressive <a href=\"\/galbadia\/3035-435\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-435\">Galbadian<\/a> government blooms into an international crisis in which the young group must protect the world from the actions of an evil sorceress. Along the way, the characters unravel their past, and must learn the values of emotion, compassion and sacrifice.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2593\/499224-4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-499224\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2593\/499224-4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-499224\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/2593\/499224-4.png\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The reception of Final Fantasy VIII was largely positive, both critically and commercially. Even in the wake of the launch of the <a href=\"\/dreamcast\/3045-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast<\/a> on the same day, Final Fantasy VIII became the top selling video game in the United States two days after its release, and held that position for more than three weeks. In the Japanese market, 2.5 million copies were sold in the first four days. By the end of 1999, more than 6 million copies had been sold. Despite such a favorable reaction, certain developments such as the new gameplay system were controversial, which had the effect of polarizing the opinions of both experts and new players alike. Nevertheless, Final Fantasy VIII has been generally regarded as a strong iteration of the Final Fantasy series, matching the high standard that had been set by previous titles.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy VIII is similar to Final Fantasy VII, in the fact that all of the action takes place on either a <a href=\"\/world-map\/3015-611\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-611\">world map<\/a>, a <a href=\"\/pre-rendered-backgrounds\/3015-1804\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1804\">pre-rendered<\/a> map, or the <a href=\"\/battle-screen\/3015-1762\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1762\">battle screen<\/a>. The world map is a zoomed out version, and is disproportionate to the size of the sole character model, Squall. Characters can traverse the world map a number of ways such as the classic <a href=\"\/chocobo\/3015-259\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-259\">chocobo<\/a> or <a href=\"\/airship\/3055-154\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-154\">airship<\/a>. The pre-rendered map is proportionate to characters, and features all party members on screen. The backgrounds are more detailed and are directly related to the battle pre-rendered background. Battles take place in a <a href=\"\/turn-based\/3015-192\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based<\/a> fashion, similar to other games in the series.<\/p><h3>Junction System<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3603\/213559-ff81.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-213559\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3603\/213559-ff81.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-213559\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/3603\/213559-ff81.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Junction System<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">This is perhaps the most significant, yet also most controversial, additions to the gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII. In this game, <a href=\"\/magic\/3015-98\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-98\">magic<\/a> works in an entirely different way. For starters, there is no <a href=\"\/magic-meter\/3015-1876\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1876\">MP bar<\/a>; magic is stored and used up in a similar way to items. However, the important point to note is that magic can now be junctioned to each characters' statistics (i.e. Strength, Luck, Vitality, etc.) to strengthen and improve them. Obviously, more powerful magic has the effect of raising statistics a more significant amount.<\/p><p style=\"\">Besides being able to junction magic to the average stats, a big part of the gameplay comes from junctioning magic to the Status-Attack\/Defense (ST-A\/D) or Elemental-Attack\/Defense (EL-A\/D) stats. The ability to junction to these is unlocked by <a href=\"\/eidolon\/3015-5069\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5069\">Guardian Force<\/a> abilities, which open up the ability to junction. Only status-effecting magic will junction to these stats. Equipping <a href=\"\/sleeping\/3015-1538\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1538\">sleep<\/a> magic to the ST-Attack junction gives that character a higher percentage of casting Sleep on an enemy with their regular <a href=\"\/melee\/3015-444\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee<\/a> attack.<\/p><p style=\"\">Junctioning magic to the EL-A\/D stats lets the character equip status magic to the ability and depending on how much of that magic is junctioned, said character has a higher percentage of avoiding that status. Or in the case of EL-D with elemental magic, the character has a higher resistance to elemental magic. The percentages for each stat are increased the more magic the character has junctioned. So fifty Blizzards will give less of resistance to ice than 100 Blizzards will. One-hundred blizzards will give 100% resistance to ice. If those Blizzards are refined into Blizzaras (or simply draw them from enemies) fifty Blizzaras are equal to 100 Blizzards. While anything above fifty Blizzaras goes over 100% and the character begins to absorb a certain percent of that magic. The same effect is multiplied with the use of Level 3 magics (i.e. Blizzaga, Thundaras, Firagas, etc.)<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2593\/511050-14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511050\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2593\/511050-14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511050\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/2593\/511050-14.png\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Junction system not only allows for the optimization of each character's abilities, it also opens up new tactical elements of gameplay. An example of this is how magic such as <a href=\"\/poison\/3015-287\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-287\">Poison<\/a> or Confusion can be junctioned onto the attacks of certain characters, so that in battle their attacks have a chance of dealing further damage if the enemy suffers the effects of the spell.<\/p><p style=\"\">Junctioning makes leveling up an unnecessary feature in Final Fantasy VIII. Due to the fact that all <a href=\"\/level-scaling\/3015-608\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-608\">enemies scale<\/a> to the player's level and bosses don't give the player any <a href=\"\/experience-points\/3015-39\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points<\/a>. This makes low-level runs of Final Fantasy VIII not only easier to accomplish, but actually an easier way to play the game than a normal playthrough. This is because if the enemies don't hit certain levels, they don't get any of their high level magic. So in a good low-level run the character will at most face level one attacking magics (fire, thunder, blizzard).<\/p><h3>Draw System<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4231\/218460-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218460\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4231\/218460-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218460\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/4231\/218460-2.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Another significant addition is one that also revolves around the use of magic. The draw system is a method of obtaining magic quite apart from the methods seen in Final Fantasy games up to this point. Being such a major depart from the series, it may take time for old hands to get adjusted to it, however the logic behind it is quite simple. Magic, instead of being learned by characters as they level up, is obtained through the draw system. Magic can be <i>drawn<\/i> from enemies, but also from specific draw points dotted all over the world.<\/p><p style=\"\">Up to 100 items of any type of magic can be held at one time. The more items of a particular type of magic you have, the more significant effect it will have when junctioned. When in battle, drawing magic uses up a character's turn, and is not always successful. Some magic can only be obtained from monsters in battle, so it is often necessary to attempt drawing magic whenever you encounter a new foe to ensure that rare forms of magic are not missed.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are also invisible draw points throughout the world. While <a href=\"\/invisibility\/3015-317\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-317\">invisible<\/a>, they can be heard by walking near them. An ability can be aquired from Siren that allows the player to see all invisible draw points throughout the journey, even when she isn't junctioned to a character.<\/p><h3>Limit Breaks<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1992\/2370916-limit.16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2370916\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1992\/2370916-limit.16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2370916\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/1992\/2370916-limit.16.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/limit-break\/3015-304\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-304\">Limit Breaks<\/a> also make a return to this iteration of the Final Fantasy series. Instead of <a href=\"\/final-fantasy-vii\/3030-13053\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13053\">Final Fantasy VII<\/a>`s trigger to limit breaks of a Limit meter filling through damage taken, the limit breaks in Final Fantasy VIII are triggered randomly, and are more likely when the character has critical life or is affected by status ailments. The buff spell ``Aura`` can be used to increase the frequency of the limit break being triggered, and allows for limit breaks to appear at any health level. The style of limit breaks varies from character to character, being a random slot machine style casting, to a fighting game combo system, or <a href=\"\/squall-leonhart\/3005-783\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-783\">Squall<\/a>`s timing trigger <i>Renzokuken<\/i>.<\/p><h3>Triple Triad<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1992\/2370921-601px_tripletriad2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2370921\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1992\/2370921-601px_tripletriad2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2370921\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/1992\/2370921-601px_tripletriad2.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Triple Triad is a <a href=\"\/playing-cards\/3055-988\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-988\">card<\/a> <a href=\"\/minigames\/3015-116\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigame<\/a> in Final Fantasy VIII. Collecting cards is more than merely a fun break from the core narrative elements of the game, as powerful magic and items can be refined from some of the rarer cards, making it a worthwhile investment of time and resources. Triple Triad is played on a three by three grid, where cards of various characters and monsters from the game are laid. Each card has a number corresponding to each side of the card, ranging from one to nine, and A which is considered ten. The objective of the game is to lay cards as to beat the existing card on the grid with a higher number. Adjacent sides of the card are compared, and the card with the higher number will win. The ownership of the losing card will be lost on the grid and transferred to the winner. The initial turn is determined by a <a href=\"\/random-number-generation\/3015-816\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-816\">coin flip<\/a>. The winner of the game is determined by the person with the highest number of cards owned on the grid. The prize for the winner is taking one or more cards from the loser. In addition to the standard rules, there can be additional rules depending on the region.<\/p><h3>Item Refinement<\/h3><p style=\"\">Through an ability learned via junctioned Guardian Forces, characters can refine certain items into other items or spells. Several different refinement types exist, which bear different results when refining certain items: magic; healing potions; buff items; ammunition and equippable amulets are among the few types of things produced from a refinement. Different refinement ability types are learned from different Guardian Forces. For instance: Ifrit, who is a fire-based Guardian Force, learns Fire Magic Refinement.<\/p><h2><b>Characters<\/b><\/h2><p style=\"\">There are six main playable characters in Final Fantasy VIII, and numerous other important characters that we meet along the way.<\/p><h3>Squall Leonhart<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/324579-ff8_squall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324579\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/324579-ff8_squall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324579\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/3689\/324579-ff8_squall.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/squall-leonhart\/3005-783\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-783\">Squall<\/a> is the main protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII. Squall is training to be a SeeD at <a href=\"\/balamb-garden\/3035-232\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-232\">Balamb Garden<\/a>, and the game primarily follows Squall as he undertakes various missions in this <a href=\"\/mercenary\/3015-2073\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2073\">mercenary<\/a> role. He initially starts off as a quiet and reserved person, however the influence of characters such as Rinoa encourage him to come out of his shell. It is learned later on in the game that Squall, like a number of the other characters, was raised in an <a href=\"\/orphanage\/3035-3875\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3875\">orphanage<\/a> run by <a href=\"\/edea-kramer\/3005-2479\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2479\">Matron<\/a>.

She accompanies Squall on the tutorial mission by defeating <a href=\"\/ifrit\/3005-2883\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2883\">Ifrit<\/a> in the Fire Cave, and provides guidance on both the Junction System and the use of summonable monsters, known as <a href=\"\/eidolon\/3015-5069\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5069\">Guardian Forces<\/a>. It is hinted that Quistis has romantic feelings for Squall when she shares this with him early in the game. Quistis is the only character in the game, and first in the franchise, that is able to break the 9,999 damage limit. This is possible with her final limit break, Shockwave Pulsar.  Quistis is capable of insta-killing any regular enemy using her limit break Degenerator.<\/p><h3>Zell Dincht<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2639\/248085-ff8_zell.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248085\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2639\/248085-ff8_zell.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248085\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/2639\/248085-ff8_zell.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/zell-dincht\/3005-818\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-818\">Zell<\/a> first appears in the SeeD mission to <a href=\"\/dollet\/3035-444\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-444\">Dollet<\/a>, as he is placed in the same team as Squall and <a href=\"\/seifer-almasy\/3005-792\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-792\">Seifer<\/a>. Zell is egregious and prone to extreme outbursts of emotion, in complete contrast to Squall. Zell's <a href=\"\/limit-break\/3015-304\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-304\">limit break<\/a>, Duel, is one of the strongest limit breaks in the Final Fantasy series, as it allows the player to hit the enemy a great number of times if utilized correctly. The limit break encompasses Zell performing different fighting moves, and more moves can be unlocked through the finding of issues of the Combat King magazine.  Though Zell \"learns\" new moves from Combat King magazines, those magazines simply add new ui elements during his limit break.  He is capable of using all of his dual techniques at any time so long as the player inputs the correct button inputs.<\/p><h3>Selphie Tilmitt<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306730-ff8_selphie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306730\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306730-ff8_selphie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306730\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/5128\/306730-ff8_selphie.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/selphie-tilmitt\/3005-1603\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1603\">Selphie<\/a> is an exchange student from Trabia Garden who is also training to become a SeeD. Selphie is a sweet and bubbly character, and is first properly introduced to her on the Dollet mission at the Communication Tower. Here she joins up with Squall and Zell shortly after Seifer leaves the party, and also accompanies them on later missions.  Selphie is the only character in the Final Fantasy series that can insta-kill almost any enemy in the game, including bosses.  Selphie's limit break, The End, is capable of killing the game's final boss.  Oddly, the only enemies that are immune to The End are undead enemies.<\/p><h3>Rinoa Heartilly<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306725-ff8_rinoa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306725\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306725-ff8_rinoa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306725\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/5128\/306725-ff8_rinoa.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/rinoa-heartilly\/3005-797\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-797\">Rinoa<\/a> is first introduced during the Graduation Ball cutscene when she forces Squall to dance. As the leader of the resistance group, Forest Owls, she was in Balamb Garden to seek SeeD's assistance in liberating <a href=\"\/timber\/3035-440\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-440\">Timber<\/a> from <a href=\"\/galbadia\/3035-435\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-435\">Galbadian<\/a> control. Rinoa has a strong sense of justice and is willing to stand up for what she believes in. She is averse to being controlled and often acts on impulse, as seen during <a href=\"\/edea-kramer\/3005-2479\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2479\">Sorceress Edea<\/a>'s assassination plot where she attempts to take on Edea by herself. Rinoa was not brought up in Matron\u2019s orphanage, but has instead lived a life of privilege. It is this that has perhaps contributed to her rebellious streak.  Rinoa is capable of turning the entire party invincible using her limit break Invincible Moon.<\/p><h3>Irvine Kinneas<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306714-ff8_irvine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306714\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306714-ff8_irvine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306714\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/5128\/306714-ff8_irvine.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/irvine-kinneas\/3005-812\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-812\">Irvine<\/a> is a skilled sharpshooter, and it is because of this that he is assigned the role of hitman during the assassination mission. Despite his cool exterior and Casanova-like persona, Irvine is an insecure individual. At the last moment, he is almost unable to take the shot and Squall has to calm him down to prevent jeopardizing the mission. As Irvine has only made use of Guardian Forces for a short while, he does not suffer the same side effects as the others. It is because of this that he is able to remember that they share a common bond; having all grown up together as children in Edea\u2019s orphanage.  Irvine is easily able to deal 9999 damage repeatedly using his armor piercing shot and hyper shot limit breaks.<\/p><h3>Seifer Almasy<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306728-ff8_seifer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306728\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306728-ff8_seifer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306728\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/5128\/306728-ff8_seifer.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Balamb Garden's only other <a href=\"\/gunblade\/3055-314\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-314\">gunblade<\/a> specialist besides Squall; <a href=\"\/seifer-almasy\/3005-792\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-792\">Seifer<\/a> is an extraordinarily arrogant and antagonistic figure throughout the entirety of the story. During a presidential broadcast Seifer attempts to kidnap president Vinzer Deling of Galbadia, however Sorceress Edea \u2018saves\u2019 the president and manipulates Seifer into becoming her knight. After this point, he becomes a main enemy to the SeeD mercenaries, preventing Squall and company from completing their goal of assassinating the Sorceress.<\/p><h3>Laguna Loire<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306766-ff8_laguna.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306766\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5128\/306766-ff8_laguna.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-306766\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/0\/5128\/306766-ff8_laguna.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The energetic leader of a small squad of Galbadian soldiers, <a href=\"\/laguna-loire\/3005-821\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-821\">Laguna<\/a> is also the main character of FFVIII's dream sequences.

It is later revealed that these actions are the result of Edea being possessed by the evil Sorceress <a href=\"\/ultimecia\/3005-1131\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1131\">Ultmecia<\/a>, and that she actually has a kind and caring temperament. She ran the orphanage at which a number of the other characters were raised as children.<\/p><h2>Guardian Forces<\/h2><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy VIII has a wide array of <a href=\"\/eidolon\/3015-5069\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5069\">Guardian Forces<\/a> (GFs) that can be assigned to any of the playable characters. GFs are significant for a number of reasons. The use of GFs can help overcome difficult bosses, and they are integral to progression through the game. This is another example of how FFVIII breaks away from the traditional approrach taken by the series. Summonable creatures ordinarily take a secondary role in battles, but FFVIII places them directly at the forefront of the action. As each GF gets stronger, it will learn new abilities, such as allowing the summoner to assign magic to a new attribute, for example. Some GFs are unlocked by defeating them in battle, while others are drawn from opponents. Collecting all of the GFs is a popular side-quest for many players, and it is by no means an easy task.<\/p><p style=\"\">Guardian Forces are key to building the main characters and are tied directly to the Junctioning system. Without a GF junctioned to him or her, a character cannot perform any actions in battle except for Fight. Junctioning the Guardian Force allows characters to select and customize their battle commands, including using Items, casting Magic, etc. Moreover, as a Guardian stays junctioned to a character and participates in battle, the affinity between a Guardian Force and that character grows. One of the more obvious benefits to a higher affinity is that the Guardian Force will unleash its attack quicker when summoned as a result.<\/p><p style=\"\">All GFs, except for GFs that deal a fixed amount of damage (<a href=\"\/diablos\/3005-3706\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3706\">Diablos<\/a>, <a href=\"\/jumbo-cactuar\/3005-3721\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3721\">Jumbo Cactuar<\/a>) or GFs that cast support magic (<a href=\"\/carbuncle\/3005-3707\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3707\">Carbuncle<\/a>, Cerberus, <a href=\"\/siren\/3005-3704\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3704\">Siren<\/a>, etc.), have an unlockable ability called Boost. Every GF that has the potential to earn this ability can do so when first obtained. Boost is achieved tapping a specific button during the GFs attacking animation. At the bottom right is an icon with a number starting at 70 and a hand pointing at it. While the GF is attacking, the player has a limited amount of time to repeatedly tap the button to make the number increase. At random intervals a red \"X\" will appear over the hand, warning the player to stop pressing the button a little bit. The player has a few chances for accidentally doing it, but pressing the button more than three times when the red \"X\" is on screen will reset the boost number back to 70. The higher the number for boost, the higher the damage of the regular GF attack.<\/p><h3>Quezacotl<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4495\/1346611-quezacotl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1346611\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4495\/1346611-quezacotl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1346611\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_medium\/0\/4495\/1346611-quezacotl.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Quezacotl<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/quezacotl\/3005-3702\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3702\">Quezacotl<\/a> and Shiva are the first two GFs found in the game. <a href=\"\/squall-leonhart\/3005-783\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-783\">Squall<\/a> can find them in his desk at the very beginning of the game.

At level 100, Diablos will attack 100% of the enemies HP. Diablos' most useful abilities are <b>Mug<\/b> &amp; <b>Abilityx3<\/b>. Mug is an action that replaces the characters attack option.

Uematsu, like with <a href=\"\/final-fantasy-vii\/3030-13053\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13053\">Final Fantasy VII<\/a>, took advantage of the sound capabilities of Sony's <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a> which enabled him to create a richer sound than in previous titles. The game and its soundtrack are both known for being somewhat anomalous in the long running series. For the soundtrack this is evidenced by Uematsu's clear break with the work he has done on previous games. Uematsu started doing more full orchestral work and the soundtrack has more electronic influences than ever before. Furthermore, the overall narrative of the music can be described as more cinematic than audiences came to expect from Uematsu.<\/p><p style=\"\">The most notable tracks on the soundtrack are the opening theme, called \"Liberi Fatali\"--meaning something along the lines of \"Fated Children\"--and \"Eyes On Me\". Liberi Fatali is a full orchestral piece arranged by Shiro Hamaguchi and accompanies the game's opening cinematic. Its main melody is used as a <i>leitmotif<\/i>for several pieces used for key scenes in the game's story. The song is also notable for its use of a full choir. The other song, Eyes on Me, is notable because it is a ballad with full vocals and is used in-game. The use of a pop song with vocals was a first for the Final Fantasy franchise and has set a trend which continued on up until the most recent Final Fantasy game. Eyes On Me was composed by Uematsu and sung by the famous Chinese singer <a href=\"\/faye-wong\/3040-16855\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16855\">Faye Wong<\/a>. The song's lyrics were written by Kako Someya. The melody of this song is the <i>leitmotif<\/i> for various other pieces which signify romantic moments in the game's story--for example, Julia's theme in certain flashbacks and related moments. It was released on CD in Japan which subsequently sold over 400,000 units. Eyes on Me has been the best-selling piece of video game music in Japan until the release of \"Hikari\" by singer Utada Hikaru for the first of the <a href=\"\/kingdom-hearts\/3030-10983\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10983\">Kingdom Hearts<\/a> games. The song is also noteworthy because it is the first piece of video game music to win an award at the Annual Japan Gold Disc Awards.<\/p><h3><b>Final Fantasy VIII - Original Soundtrack<\/b><\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>Disc One<\/b><\/p><ul><li>01 -

In this game 50 <a data-ref-id=\"3055-910\" href=\"\/airplane\/3055-910\/\">planes<\/a> will be available to the players to use in aerial combat. The game will feature four-player co-op mode in the campaign, which players will be able to jump in and out at anytime during the game. The multiplayer will support 16 players battling online to gain in-game money or experience to invest in new weapons and equipment. The developers added an Enhanced Reality System, which gives the player access to anti-crash system, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3542\" href=\"\/radar\/3015-3542\/\">radar<\/a>, incoming missile detection, damage control system, weapons trajectory control, and the option to command your AI wingmen .<\/p><p style=\"\">Each target you destroy in the game will add to your experience total; the player may level up 40 times in the game, and at each level it will unlock new single player <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4011\" href=\"\/campaign\/3015-4011\/\">campaign<\/a> missions, new aircraft, and new weapon systems to specific aircraft in the hangar.

The player will begin the game flying for the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-396\" href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\">United States<\/a> and particitipating in a mission to assist the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-557\" href=\"\/ghost-recon\/3025-557\/\">Ghost Recon<\/a> team down on the ground in Juarez, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-249\" href=\"\/mexico\/3035-249\/\">Mexico<\/a>. Shortly thereafter the HAWX Squadron is decommissioned from the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-656\" href=\"\/usaaf-united-states-army-air-force\/3030-656\/\">United States Air Force<\/a> and is eventually contracted with the Private Military Company, Artemis. Artemis is in the business of warfare, taking contracts from different nations and companies to defend, escort, or destroy opponents to their interests; the HAWX Squadron is there to carry out those missions. The story is relatively diverse and will take the player into various situations all around the world, and for different services.<\/p><p style=\"\">The campaign is set between <a data-ref-id=\"3030-270\" href=\"\/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter-2\/3030-270\/\">GRAW 2<\/a> (the first mission in HAWX is at the same time as the last mission in GRAW 2) and before the events of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20739\" href=\"\/tom-clancys-endwar\/3030-20739\/\">Endwar<\/a> (The game makes mention of the joint US - EU missile shield).

Well built and relatively inexpensive it is utilized in the air forces of nearly 30 countries around the world. In addition to having a powerful engine that can propel the Mig-29 to top speeds of almost Mach 2.3 the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4529\" href=\"\/mikoyan\/3055-4529\/\">Mig-29<\/a> and its derivatives are one of the most agile aircraft in the world. In fact, until the advent of Thrust vectoring enabled aircraft in the 2000's the Mig-29 could outperform in close combat any warplane that was currently in service.<\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-4529\" href=\"\/mikoyan\/3055-4529\/\"><b>Mig-33 Super Fulcrum<\/b><\/a> - The super Fulcrum is a more advanced export version of the Mig-29<\/li><li><b>Su-35 Super Flanker<\/b> - The Superflanker is a generation 4.5 long range heavy multi role fighter built by Russia. Unlike the western system of adding a number to designate aircraft evolutions, the Russians rename their planes as newer models are produced. As such the Su-35 is the final evolution of the legendary Su-27 series of planes that were originally built by the USSR. This model is considered to be close cousin of the Indian airforce's SU-30 MKI that is considered by many experts to be one of the most advanced and potent weapon system on the planet.<\/li><li><b>Su-37 Terminator<\/b> - The terminator was an experimental plane built to study thrust vectoring. For all practical purposes it is an SU-27 that has been modified with thrust vectoring engines.<\/li><li><b>Su-47 Berkut<\/b> - The Su-47 was originally conceived in the early 1980's to the next generation of fighters in the soviet air force. However, after the collapse of the USSR, the Su-47 was made into an advanced technological demonstrator. Its unique feature is its forward swept wings which gives it exceptionally good performance in sub-sonic speeds.<\/li><li><b><a data-ref-id=\"3055-5296\" href=\"\/f-16-fighting-falcon\/3055-5296\/\">F-16 FIGHTING FALCON<\/a><\/b> - Built in the 1970's the generation 4.0 Falcon remains to date the most popular western aircraft ever built, with around 4400 exported to foreign countries. The falcon is considered to be a multi purpose aircraft and it has an impeccable service record. The aircraft has been constantly upgraded over the passage of time and remains a very versatile and effective platform.<\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-4283\" href=\"\/f-22-raptor\/3055-4283\/\"><b>F-22 RAPTOR<\/b><\/a> - The raptor is the world's first and only Generation 5.0 Fighter and it optimizes the USAF's dominance of the sky. Built with stealth in mind, the aircraft is capable to fighting its way into heavily defended areas and then fighting its way out of there. Although much of its specifications are classified, it is regarded as the best fighter in the world by many aviation experts.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a data-ref-id=\"3055-5297\" href=\"\/f-35-lightning-ii\/3055-5297\/\">F-35 LIGHTNING II<\/a><\/b> - The Lightning-2 takes the venerable F-16 platform and the heavier F-22 and incorporates many of their best features. Designed to replace the F-16, it is a single engine STOVL capable aircraft. While not as advanced as its more expensive cousin, the Raptor, the F-35 is still considered to be a generation 5.0 aircraft.<\/li><li><b><a data-ref-id=\"3055-4531\" href=\"\/eurofighter-typhoon\/3055-4531\/\">Eurofighter Typhoon<\/a><\/b> - Built by a consortium of European countries, the Eurofighter is a twin engined, generation 4.5 aircraft. It is considered by many experts to be the best 4.5 gen fighter and its performance has been compared very favorably to the F\/A-18, F-16 and even the Generation 5.0 Raptor.

Despite the overwhelming numbers, Spider-man turns the tide once Mary Jane arrives with a shotgun aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. transport. Enraged at the interference, Black Cat orders all nearby symbiotes to target Mary Jane instead. With Mary Jane's help, Spider-man continues to eliminate the remaining symbiotes. Black Cat, sensing her imminent defeat , attacks Mary Jane directly and almost succeeds in killing her. With no other choice, Spider-man is forced to viciously defeat Felicia to save the life of Mary Jane.

None too pleased with the actions Spider-man has taken, Venom tries to destroy Spider-man once and for all.<\/p><p style=\"\">Frantically fighting for his life, Spider-man systematically destroys the extra heads of Venom.

Refusing Peter's help, Eddie Brock drags himself into a nearby engine turbine, trapping the gargantuan Symbiote aboard the exploding ship.

The format is simiiar to that of other LEGO adventure games, which involves solving platformer puzzles (pulling levers, putting blocks on pressure pads, etc) and destroying the environment to collect coins, which can then later be used to buy extras such as suit upgrades and new playable characters.

The player can perform a variety of attacks including a selection of basic punches and stronger swings. There are also defensive moves such as blocks, which can lead to counter attacks. A range of unusual weaponry is also available, often made from pieces of scrap and junk combined with crude stone and bleached bone. Although a majority of the game's combat is spent in hand-to-hand combat, two melee weapons do exist: a sword made of strapped-together bones and a large, anvil-headed <a href=\"..\/..\/hammer\/93-308\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">hammer<\/a>.

The campaign only features single player, and there have been no announced plans to add any multiplayer.<\/p><h4>Challenge Mode<\/h4><p style=\"\">Challenge mode is the competitive mode of Zeno Clash. Players will fight through 5 floors of enemies and challenges in the quickest time they possibly can. This time is then added to a leaderboard where the player can check their friends' times, as well as players who are in the same <a href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam<\/a> groups as them. There are eight levels, each with five different challenges to be completed. Five of these levels (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) were including in the original game release.

Like most modern third-person shooters, it draws heavily on precedents set by <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\" href=\"\/gears-of-war\/3030-12231\/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War<\/a>, with an over-the-should camera, radio conversations during which player speed is reduced, and plenty of chest-high pieces of cover. The roles of major characters from the movie are played and voiced over by their respective actors with the exception of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10857\" href=\"\/john-connor\/3005-10857\/\" slug=\"john-connor\">John Connor<\/a>, for whom Christian Bale refused to lend his likeness or voice to.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">Picking up after what appears to be a failed attack by the humans, the Resistance is on retreat. The first few levels of the game chronicle Connor's journey to the extraction site. Upon reaching it, the Resistance receives a radio transmission from David Weston, a member of the Resistance whose team is stranded in Skynet territory. Connor and his team are required to fend off waves of machines in order to secure a landing zone for the choppers meant to extract them.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon their arrival, the commanding officer refuses to go back for the stranded members and insists that Connor get on the chopper and follow orders. Connor and his companion throughout the game, Blair Williams, stay behind in order to rescue them. Before the choppers can escape safely, a machine known as a Harvester attacks and destroys them.<\/p><p style=\"\">After narrowly escaping, the two are hailed by a team on a rescue helicopter that was downed. Connor and Williams move quickly to save them. After fending off machines at the downed chopper, the three surviving members of the rescue team, Dobkin, Deckard and Angie, join Connor and Williams as they journey to an old Resistance outpost to resupply. Upon reaching the outpost, the team is ambushed by a group of T-600's, resulting in the deaths of Deckard and Dobkin. Angie, Blair and Connor survive and push on together to rescue Weston's team.<\/p><p style=\"\">Continuing their journey, they head into the underground subway tunnels of L.A. and stumble upon a group of Survivalists, humans who are not a part of the Resistance, surviving on their own by hiding underground and fighting defensively. Connor is greeted by the leader, Warren, wielding a knife, demanding that he cut himself to prove he is human and not a disguised machine. After it's confirmed that Connor is human, the Survivalists agree to supplying them as they continue their trek to Weston. Not long after, machines attack, following the trail of Connor and Williams to the underground base. The two return to the entrance to hold off the machines while the Survivalists prepare to run with Barnes, a Survivalist who has rigged explosives up there. After successfully holding the entrance and setting off the explosives, the group returns to defend the others as they disembark.<\/p><p style=\"\">After coming to a stop, Connor tries to get in contact with Weston, only to find that Skynet is jamming the signal. Warren points out the Skynet radio tower responsible and mocks Connor's cavalier attitude towards destroying it. He leaves to guide the other Survivalists to safety while Barnes joins the crew on their mission. They successfully assault and destroy the radio tower, losing Angie in the process, who sacrifices her own life for theirs.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon resurfacing, the remaining members of the team are greeted by the Survivalists who saw the tower go down. Warren pledges the support of the Survivalists to Connor. Still needing to push into Skynet territory, Connor calls in for Resistance air support. They inform him that AA turrets in the area prevent them from coming in safely. In response, he rewires an enemy tank for his own use, taking out a majority of the anti-aircraft. Connor and his men are forced to take the remaining ones offline on foot. As they assault the machine base, they are able to rescue Weston and his men. The injured are taken back to the Survivalist vehicles for extraction by the Resistance while Weston joins the team and helps push to the control room. Connor and crew take the turrets offline and set off an EMP, disabling ground resistance and giving them enough time to escape.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Resistance moves quickly, nuking Skynet and extracting Connor and his team, including the newly recruited Survivalists. The game closes with Connor reflecting on what has occurred and discussing his newfound faith in the future.<\/p><h2>Levels<\/h2><ul><li>L.A. 2016<\/li><li>Heaven<\/li><li>New Acquaintances<\/li><li>The Sights<\/li><li>Underground<\/li><li>Into the Wild<\/li><li>Angie<\/li><li>Every Life is Sacred<\/li><li>For the Resistance!<\/li><\/ul><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Salvation's general gameplay is incredibly simplistic, usually requiring the player to bound from cover-to-cover so that they can position themselves behind the enemy. The bulk of the game is played as a traditional third-person shooter interspersed with gunning sequences, during which Connor controls the weapons on a moving vehicle, from truck mounted machine guns and grenade launchers to the Gatling guns and rocket launchers on the tank. The player is not given control over the movement of the vehicles.<\/p><p style=\"\">Player arsenal is rather limited, consisting of unnamed, generic weapons types. It consists of an assault rifle, a shotgun, a light machine gun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, fragmentation grenades and pipebombs. The AI is surprisingly proficient and wary.<\/p><p style=\"\">Player allies will draw the attention of the enemies so Connor can flank them and target weak spots on the machines. Most of the enemies only attempt to suppress the player and their allies, however one particular type, the T-600, will also maneuver in ways to flank the player and push on weak points in their defenses.<\/p><h2><strong>Enemies<\/strong><\/h2><p style=\"\"><strong>The list of enemies is short, most seen within the first hour or two of gameplay.<\/strong><\/p><h3>T7-T<\/h3><p style=\"\">Nicknamed \"Spiders\" by characters in game, these are one of the most common enemies encountered. They have a weak spot located on the back, behind forward armour plating.<\/p><h3>Aerostat<\/h3><p style=\"\">Nicknamed \"Wasps\" by characters in game, these are one of the most common enemies encountered. While not having one particular weak spot, they are all around lightly armoured, and can easily be destroyed by a single shotgun round.<\/p><h3>Hunter Killer<\/h3><p style=\"\">Nicknamed \"HK\" by characters in game. The player only encounters this enemy twice throughout the game where they pose a threat. Heavily armed and unable to be harmed by small arms fire.<\/p><h3>T-600<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are two types of T-600s, nicknamed \"Endos\" and \"Skinjobs\". <b>Endos<\/b> are the sort pictured on the cover of the game, armed with a Gatling gun and having an exposed metal skeleton. They have a weak point located on their chest. <b>Skinjobs<\/b> are armed the same way but covered with rubber skin and tattered clothing. They have no designated weak point.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is another enemy that goes unnamed, given neither an official Skynet designation or a nickname, found only when the player is defending the fleeing Survivalists. It is a motorcycle that has no rider and is completely self-driven, armed with dual mounted machine guns.<\/p><h2>PC Release Problems and Recall<\/h2><p style=\"\">Upon release, users quickly discovered an issue with the PC versions of the game. Consumers who had purchased physical copies of the game found themselves unable to install it due to a defect with the physical disc, later attributed to an issue with the replication process. There was a recall in North America on defective discs, which were quickly replaced with functional versions of the game. Digital copies of the game and console versions were unaffected.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/1\/13158\/1110143-gb.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/13158\/1110143-gb.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/1\/13158\/1110143-gb.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/13158\/1110143-gb.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/1\/13158\/1110143-gb.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/1\/13158\/1110143-gb.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/1\/13158\/1110143-gb.png"},"name":"Terminator Salvation"}],"version":"1.0"}
