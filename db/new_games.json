There is a squad and base management metagame, with the main gameplay being tactical, turn-based strategy, taking a great deal of influence from the X-COM PC games.<\/p><p style=\"\">The player takes control of PHALANX, the agency assigned to take care of the alien threat, conducting alien research, maintaining international relations and building weapons and various other combat items in what is referred to as <em>Geoscape<\/em> mode. The combat is referred to as <em>Tactical<\/em> mode, and involves navigating an armed squad on a map, saving civilians and combatting aliens.<\/p><h2>Geoscape Mode<\/h2><p style=\"\">In <i>Geoscape<\/i> mode, the game is about base management and strategy. The player manages the activities and finances of PHALANX, controlling bases, installations, aircraft and squads of armed-response troops. They will also research new technologies and use their results in battle against the aliens, as well as launching interceptor aircraft to shoot down UFOs and dispatching dropships in response to alien activity across the globe. <\/p><p style=\"\"><i>Geoscape<\/i> mode employs time buttons to control the passage of time, automatically pausing whenever there's an important message to see. Research will progress and items will be produced as time passes.<\/p><h2>Tactical Mode<\/h2><p style=\"\">In <i>Tactical<\/i> mode, the game is about taking command of the team in various missions to combat the alien threat. The same soldiers which have been managed and equipped in <em>Geoscape<\/em> mode will be employed here. Civilians and other bystanders may be found during the mission, being targeted and executed by the aliens.<\/p><p style=\"\"><i>Tactical<\/i> mode uses a turn-based system, where the player's team and the aliens take turns to make moves. During a turn the player can order troops to move around, fire their weapons, throw grenades or use other equipment. Each soldier gets a certain number of Time Units (TUs), representing the total time they have to act during the current turn. All actions in Tactical mode require Time Units to perform. Once a soldier is out of Time Units, they can't do anything more until the next turn.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game also includes a multiplayer mode, which can be played over LAN or an internet connection. Multiplayer mode can have two players play as either the aliens or the humans and fight one another, or up to 6 players can join co-operatively for 3 teams per side.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/2\/23808\/1094183-ufo_logo_blood.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/23808\/1094183-ufo_logo_blood.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/2\/23808\/1094183-ufo_logo_blood.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/23808\/1094183-ufo_logo_blood.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/2\/23808\/1094183-ufo_logo_blood.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/2\/23808\/1094183-ufo_logo_blood.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/2\/23808\/1094183-ufo_logo_blood.png"},"name":"UFO: Alien Invasion"},{"description":"<p style=\"\">An early, Russian-language game to be leaked to the West.\u00a0 In it, your character, named \"democrat\" attempts to change the staid system by hopping on lilypads (representing ever-changing laws) on the way to the opposite corner of the screen where the milestones of reform lay, all while gathering dots (representing bankable currency and groceries, among other things, although you should avoid the taxes) and bypassing bureaucrats while trying to accumulate points. <br\/>\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0<br\/><br\/><\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/913\/1364590-perestroika.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/913\/1364590-perestroika.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/913\/1364590-perestroika.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/913\/1364590-perestroika.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/913\/1364590-perestroika.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/913\/1364590-perestroika.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/913\/1364590-perestroika.png"},"name":"Toppler"},{"description":"<h2><b>Overview<\/b><\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4560\/217315-x_com_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-217315\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4560\/217315-x_com_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-217315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4560\/217315-x_com_1.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>The Geoscape<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Originally released in the UK as UFO: Enemy Unknown, X-COM: UFO Defense combines challenging turn-based gameplay with base building, research management, and persistent squad members.

All missions play out in turns, with the player always going first. Troops have Action Points that are depleted by everything from moving and shooting to turning and priming grenades.<\/p><p style=\"\">Alien weaponry is far superior to your troop's early rifles and heavy cannons, requiring caution and overlapping movement to keep squad members alive. A sort of overwatch allows soldiers to save action points for the alien turn, and, depending on an individual's Reaction stat, he or she may fire on an alien that moves into line of sight. UFOs may also land, supposedly to abduct people or cattle, or just to do some Earthly research of their own, and your transport ships can catch the aliens off guard. Research rewards are often better, as the UFO itself is not damaged like when your Interceptors shoot them down. However, this also means that there will be more aliens to contend with on the ground.<\/p><p style=\"\">Terror missions are arguably the most difficult, as they occur at inopportune times around the world and last only a few game days, leaving little time to prepare before the city is ransacked. Failing or ignoring these missions will make the local government unhappy, which might lead to funding cuts at the end of the month. In Terror missions, the aliens set out to kill as many civilians as possible, so your job is to protect the citizens by quelling the alien threat as quickly as possible.<\/p><p style=\"\">Aliens also will try to construct bases on Earth, as evidenced by heavy UFO activity in certain countries (a month by month stat page can help highlight this sort of information). These missions are completed by killing or capturing all aliens inside. It is worth noting that at the core of the bases, a high-ranking alien can usually be found who will yield valuable information if taken alive and interrogated.<\/p><p style=\"\">The world map progresses with time, and missions can be taken during night or day. All the aliens have the unique advantage of seeing just as well at night as you do during the day, making Terror missions an absolute nightmare during the evening hours.<\/p><h2>Aliens<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are five alien races, each with an associated support unit, usually only seen on the Terror missions or within their bases.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2942\/380849-sectoid_alive.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380849\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2942\/380849-sectoid_alive.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380849\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2942\/380849-sectoid_alive.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Sectoid<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li><h3>Sectoids<\/h3><\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The Sectoids are based on the bug-eyed grays so common in extraterrestrial movies, shows, and games.

You must hire and pay all personnel and also pay upkeep for your various facilities on a monthly basis. Radar systems, storage areas, living quarters, and research and manufacturing areas must be constructed to accommodate your alien hunting ventures. Later, base defenses, alien containment, and more hangar space become important to your mission. Management of weapons and ammunition for troops and ships also occurs here.<\/p><p style=\"\">Should your base be invaded by hostile forces you will have to defend yourself within the base you have constructed. Aliens will infiltrate through possible entry zones, like gun ports and hangars. Supplies that you don't allocate to the team that happens to be there to defend the base will be in storage areas, and not all of the base is well-lit (read: hangars), making visibility a problem. It is difficult to build a base defensively, and invasions can often be devastating if you're not ready for them (including losing your base as a consequence if you lose the fight), so it's best to guard against invasions by putting up strong defensive weapons and other defenses you learn about later in the game, as well as having some defenders at the base in case of attack, especially in the later levels.<\/p><h2>Research &amp; Development<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2942\/388637-laser_defences.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-388637\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2942\/388637-laser_defences.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-388637\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2942\/388637-laser_defences.png\"><\/a><figcaption>Laser Defences UFOpedia entry<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Hiring and utilizing scientists and engineers allows progress in the game, both technologically and story-wise. More powerful and varied weapons are made available, as well as personal armor, building types, and information about the aliens. Psychic research also becomes part of the gameplay, allowing your troops to use the alien's mind control and terrifying abilities against them. The later aircraft are necessary for completing the game, and only by bringing in live aliens will your scientists discover a way to eradicate the alien menace. Learning new things opens up new avenues of research, propelling you toward having the tools to bring about the conclusion-- as long as you allocate enough scientists to the task.<\/p><h2>UFO Interception<\/h2><p style=\"\">When pursuing enemy craft with your aircraft on the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5043\" href=\"\/geoscape\/3015-5043\/\" slug=\"geoscape\">Geoscape<\/a>, you may get within firing range. This spawns an intercept minigame which pits your craft against the UFO. Smaller UFOs tend to be more fragile and less heavily armed, while the top of the line enemy ships can easily wipe out your aircraft, especially if the aircraft's armament doesn't have sufficient range to afford to stay away. When at a stand-off distance, you can actually minimize this pursuit to manage other onscreen events (like other pursuit craft). The button for this is in the upper right corner of the pop-up. In older versions, this would sometimes lead to a crash.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the screen to the left, you see the pop-up box that connotes the intercept mode. The green-colored field to the far left of the pop-up visualizes your distance to your target, and the range and ammunition that your weapons have.

It's also possible that the enemy could run away, destroy your craft, cause you to retreat, or be completely destroyed by your weaponry or by crashing into the sea.<\/p><h2>PC Requirements<\/h2><ul><li>Supported OS: Microsoft\u00ae 2000\/XP\/Vista\u00ae<\/li><li>Processor: 80386 processor or better<\/li><li>Memory: 4Mb RAM<\/li><li>Sound Cards Supported: AdLib compatible cards, SoundBlaster compatible cards and the Roland LAPC<\/li><\/ul>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/11\/117587\/2370096-xcombox.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/117587\/2370096-xcombox.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/11\/117587\/2370096-xcombox.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/117587\/2370096-xcombox.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/11\/117587\/2370096-xcombox.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/11\/117587\/2370096-xcombox.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/11\/117587\/2370096-xcombox.jpg"},"name":"X-COM: UFO Defense"},{"description":null,"image":null,"name":"Ace Ventura Pet Detective: The Case of the Serial Shaver"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Asterix and Obelix Take on Caesar is a game developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-218\" href=\"\/tek-5\/3010-218\/\" slug=\"tek-5\">Tek 5<\/a> (<a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" slug=\"playstation\">Playstation<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" slug=\"pc\">PC<\/a> versions) and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-217\" href=\"\/cryo-interactive-entertainment\/3010-217\/\" slug=\"cryo-interactive-entertainment\">Cryo Interactive<\/a> (<a data-ref-id=\"3045-57\" href=\"\/game-boy-color\/3045-57\/\" slug=\"game-boy-color\">Game Boy Color<\/a> version).

It is considered a first person shooter, despite being vehicular based, drawing inspiration from Wing Commander for the PC. Like its predecessor, you are able to move freely in any direction as the entirety of the game takes place underwater. The game features 24 missions across two discs, and like Wing Commander, makes liberal use of Full Motion Video.<br\/><br\/><h2>Story<\/h2>The player is put in the role of a new graduated private (callsign MORAY 2) from the Academy, a training institute for submarine pilots. The Academy is a part of a wholly underwater civilization which is under siege by enemy threats (the Shadowkin) and a seemingly natural disintegration of the environment. Ultimately, the goal is to aid the civilization develop a mother ship and then protect it in order to transport the entire society from these threats.<br\/><br\/><h2>Gameplay<\/h2>As noted, the core mechanic of the game is full 3D motion in a fluid, allowing for control much like Wing Commander and Descent. Throughout the course of the game, you pilot a series of 5 subs and an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) that are suited for a variety of tasks. One of the key gameplay elements is combat, which operates much like dogfights in a flight or space sim, often engaging numerous enemies with the aid of teammates. Battles are broken up by pathfinding, item collection, and puzzle solving, all of which are designed specifically around the idea of full 3D motion.","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/2\/26220\/848546-27f.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/26220\/848546-27f.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/2\/26220\/848546-27f.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/26220\/848546-27f.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/2\/26220\/848546-27f.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/2\/26220\/848546-27f.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/2\/26220\/848546-27f.jpg"},"name":"Deep Fighter"},{"description":null,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/1582\/523072-alien_cabal_04.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1582\/523072-alien_cabal_04.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/1582\/523072-alien_cabal_04.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1582\/523072-alien_cabal_04.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/1582\/523072-alien_cabal_04.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/1582\/523072-alien_cabal_04.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/1582\/523072-alien_cabal_04.jpg"},"name":"Alien Cabal"},{"description":"<p style=\"\">Eskel and Sogrom are the greatest magicians in the land and are so hungry for power that they've been at war for a long time.\u00a0 Now the war is nearing it's end but neither one wants to give up.<br\/><br\/>Celtic Legends is a turn based strategy game in which you must destroy the other wizards forces on 23 islands.\u00a0 Holding on to castles will grant you more magic, more magic means a bigger army and a bigger army of course means more fun putting your enemies to the sword.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/10\/101958\/2297620-celt.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/101958\/2297620-celt.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/10\/101958\/2297620-celt.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101958\/2297620-celt.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/10\/101958\/2297620-celt.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/10\/101958\/2297620-celt.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/10\/101958\/2297620-celt.png"},"name":"Celtic Legends"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Beyond Oasis is an action adventure similar to the Legend of Zelda series, whilst taking a more action\/combat heavy approach.

Even though Beyond Oasis was called The Story of Thor in other parts of the world (including Europe), the European \"Mega Drive Ultimate Collection\" version still contains an emulated version of \"Beyond Oasis\", even when the menu still says \"The Story of Thor\". This is easily understandable, as there is no reason to emulate a separate version of a game that is identical.

The game was met with critical and commercial success and is considered by many publications (such as IGN) to be one of the greatest games of all time. The object of the game is to create a civilization that can stand the test of time. Expand, conquer, trade and spread your culture around the world with the ultimate goal of either conquering all other nations or being the first nation to colonize another world.<\/p><p style=\"\">Although the title bears his name, Sid Meier actually had little to do with creating Civilization II. The game was designed by Brian Reynolds, Jeff Briggs and Douglas Caspian-Kaufman.<\/p><h2><span>Gameplay<\/span><\/h2><p style=\"\">Civilization II is a turn based strategy game. Each game starts off on a randomly generated map in the year 4,000 B.C. The player is given one settler unit which can be used to build cities. Cities in turn can be used to bolster scientific development, generate tax income, and produce units such as more settlers, military units, and trade units. The game puts over 50 military units at a players disposal. Once a player has moved all of his \/ her units, the players turn ends, time progresses and other nations take their turns.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14035\/389614-civ2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389614\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14035\/389614-civ2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389614\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14035\/389614-civ2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Making a civilization.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As a game of Civilization II progresses, the player will discover more and more technologies, build more and more cities as well as explore more of the map. As a player explores more of the map, he or she will encounterbarbarians as well as other Civilizations vying for dominance in the world. An interesting aspect about the Civilization series is that a player can choose to play the game peacefully, one does not need to be a warmonger in order to be successful. Players can sign cease fires, peace treaties, alliances and share technology \/ military units with other nations. If a player is being particularly aggressive, his reputation will take a hit and other nations will react accordingly.<\/p><h3>Governments<\/h3><p style=\"\">There are seven government types a player can choose from, with each government offering numerous advantages \/ disadvantages. Much of the following is taken from the ingame Civiliopedia:<\/p><p style=\"\"><u><em><strong>Despotism<\/strong><\/em><\/u>: A despotism is a government in which the ruler has absolute power, usually enforced by the military. In Civilization II, Despotism is the default government, it is usually best to change government types to Monarchy as soon as possible.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14035\/389618-civ2b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389618\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14035\/389618-civ2b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389618\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14035\/389618-civ2b.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Overview of the city.<\/figcaption><\/figure><ol><li>Each unit above the city size costs one Shield per turn.<\/li><li>Settlers eat one Food per turn.<\/li><li>Up to three military units in each city institute \"martial law\". Each of these units makes one unhappy citizen content.<\/li><li>Despotism has a high rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.<\/li><li>Under a Despotism, Tax\/Luxury\/Science rates cannot be set higher than 60%.<\/li><li>Any terrain square that ordinarily produces three or more of any resource (Food, Shields, or Trade) produces one less.<\/li><li>Because of Despotism's high rate of corruption, it is almost always an inferior form of government. Try to switch to a Monarchy as soon as possible.<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\"><u><em><strong>Monarchy<\/strong><\/em><\/u>: A Monarchy is a government ruled by a King or Queen. In Civilization II, a Monarchy is a good government to have for a small, new civilization.<\/p><ol><li>Each unit beyond the third unit costs one Shield per turn.<\/li><li>Settlers eat one Food per turn.<\/li><li>Up to three military units in each city institute \"martial law\". Each of these units makes one unhappy citizen content.<\/li><li>Monarchy has a moderate rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.<\/li><li>Under a Monarchy, Tax\/Luxury\/Science rates cannot be set higher than 70%.<\/li><li>Monarchy is an excellent form of government for a young civilization.<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\"><u><em><strong>Fundamentalism<\/strong><\/em><\/u>: Fundamentalism is a form of government centered around a certain set of beliefs, usually religious. In real life, this would be akin to a theocracy. In Civilization II, Fundamentalism is a good government to have if one goes on the war path.<\/p><ol><li>Each unit beyond the tenth unit costs one Shield per turn (except Fanatics, which never require maintenance).<\/li><li>Settlers eat two Food per turn.<\/li><li>Under Fundamentalism, no citizen is ever unhappy.<\/li><li>Fundamentalism has a very low rate of corruption.<\/li><li>Under Fundamentalism, Tax\/Luxury\/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.<\/li><li>Under Fundamentalism, all Science production is HALVED.<\/li><li>Improvements that normally convert unhappy citizens to content citizens produce \"tithes\" (money) equivalent to the number of people they would normally convert, and require no maintenance.<\/li><li>The diplomatic penalties for terrorist acts committed by Diplomats and Spies is reduced.<\/li><li>Fundamentalism eliminates all happiness problems and provides excellent revenue, although research tends to languish.<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\"><u><em><strong>Republic<\/strong><\/em><\/u>: A Republic is an assembly of autonomous city-states under the control of a central government. Although the central government has the ultimate say in matters that affect the society as a whole, the city-states are given a certain amount of latitude in the governing of local affairs. In Civilization II, a Republic is a good government for scientific advancement and is usually a good fit for a medium sized empire to have.<\/p><ol><li>Each unit costs one shield per turn.<\/li><li>Settlers eat two Food per turn.<\/li><li>Each unit beyond the first unit that is not in a friendly city (or in a Fortress within three squares of a friendly city) causes one citizen in its home city to become unhappy.<\/li><li>Republics experience a low rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.<\/li><li>Under a Republic, Tax\/Luxury\/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.<\/li><li>Your senate may force a peaceful solution in a conflict.<\/li><li>Switching to a Republic can give an astounding boost to your Science and Luxury revenues, although you will probably be forced to shift some Trade to Luxuries in order to prevent unhappiness.<\/li><li>Republics make it difficult and expensive to keep a sizable army in the field, but building certain Improvements and Wonders can help to alleviate this problem.<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\"><u><em><strong>Communism<\/strong><\/em><\/u>: In a true Communist system, all property is owned collectively by the people, and labor is organized to be equally advantageous to all people. In Civilization II, Communism is a good government to have a nation on the warpath.<\/p><ol><li>Each unit beyond the third unit costs one Shield per turn.<\/li><li>Settlers eat one Food per turn.<\/li><li>Up to three military units in each city institute \"martial law\". Each of these units makes two unhappy citizens content.<\/li><li>Under Communism, state control of the economy eliminates organized crime. Your cities, therefore, experience no corruption.<\/li><li>All Spy units produced under Communist governments are Veterans.<\/li><li>Under Communism, Tax\/Luxury\/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.<\/li><li>Communism is best for large, far-flung empires that need to maintain a large military.<\/li><li>Use your powerful Spies to steal technology from the capitalist pigs!<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\"><u><em><strong>Democracy<\/strong><\/em><\/u>: A Democracy is ruled by a president elected by the people. In Civilization II, Democracies are great for peaceful empires who wish to pursue research and generate money.<\/p><ol><li>Each unit costs one shield per turn.<\/li><li>Settlers eat two Food per turn.<\/li><li>Each unit that is not in a friendly city (or in a Fortress within three squares of a friendly city) causes two citizens in its home city to become unhappy.<\/li><li>Democracies experience no corruption or waste.<\/li><li>Tax\/Luxury\/Science rates can be set to any level desired.<\/li><li>Under a Democracy, each square that ordinarily produces at least one unit of Trade produces an extra unit of Trade.<\/li><li>The units and cities of a Democracy are immune to bribery in any form.<\/li><li>Your senate may force a peaceful solution in a conflict.<\/li><li>Democracies can produce spectacular amounts of revenue and scientific research. However, because of the severe happiness restrictions on military units, this form of government tends to be viable only for large, advanced civilizations.<\/li><li>Increasing your Luxury rate and building Improvements and Wonders can help alleviate unhappiness.<\/li><\/ol><p style=\"\"><u><em><strong>Anarchy:<\/strong><\/em><\/u> Anarchy is a lack of government, and occurs in Civilization II when a nation is switching from one government type to another. Under Anarchy, many cities become unhappy and no money or scientific research is generated.<\/p><p style=\"\">Civilization II also features live action actors that serve as a council of advisers. The council will comment on how you're doing and fight with one another on what matters are more important for your empire.<\/p><h3><u><span>Playable civilizations and their color<\/span><\/u><\/h3><p style=\"\">There are 21 playable Civilizations in Civ 2. The following is a list of playable Civilizations and their ingame color<\/p><p style=\"\">White: Romans, Russian, Celts.<\/p><p style=\"\">Green: Babylonians, Zulus, Japanese.<\/p><p style=\"\">Blue: Germans, French, Vikings.<\/p><p style=\"\">Yellow: Egyptians, Aztecs, Spanish.<\/p><p style=\"\">Teal: Americans, Chinese, Persians.<\/p><p style=\"\">Orange: Greeks, English, Carthaginians.<\/p><p style=\"\">Purple: Indians, Mongols, Sioux.<\/p><p style=\"\">Red: Barbarians.<\/p><p style=\"\">Civilizations who are the same color cannot appear together in the same game. For example, the Romans and Russians cannot appear together because both are the color white. A little known fact is that the color of your civilization determines in what order your starting location is picked as well as how much you are handicapped in scientific research. The white civilization gets their starting location picked first, the green second, so and and so forth. Because the purple civilization has its location is picked last, every civilizations scientific advancement is either helped or hindered depending on how many more or less technologies one has when compared to the purple Civilization. For example, if the Romans have 10 more technologies when compared to the Indians, the Romans will research at a slower pace then they would normally. The purple civilization will always research at a normal rate. This is why if one plans on being a technologically advanced nation, it is best to pick one of the purple Civilizations.<\/p><h2>Community<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Civilization series has a strong online community. Players have come up with a number of ways to keep the game interesting, such as succession games (one player plays for a set number of turns, passes it onto someone else to play for a set number of turns, etc.), GOTM (game of the month; One of the big fansites creates a scenario every month for people to play, allowing players to directly compete and compare their results to one another). While the focus of this community tends to shift towards the newer releases in the franchise, particuaraly Civilization IV, there is still an active GOTM for Civilization II. There is also a large number of guides and strategies to be found on community fansites, as well as mods and scenarios.<\/p><p style=\"\">The two main fansites for all things Civilization:<\/p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.civfanatics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.civfanatics.com<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.apolyton.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.apolyton.com<\/a><\/p><h2>Expansion Packs and special editions<\/h2><p style=\"\">There were two expansion packs released for Civ II. The first expansion pack, Conflicts, came with 20 new scenarios, 12 created by makers of the game and 8 by fans. The second expansion pack, Fantastic Worlds, came with 19 new scenarios as well as a variety of editors for the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">In addition to expansion packs, there were three versions of Civilization II released. Civilization II, Civilization II: Gold Edition and Civilization II: Test of Time.<\/p><p style=\"\">Civilization II: Gold Edition is a slightly updated version of Civilization II. The game features multiplayer and includes both expansion packs. Civ II: Gold Edition also features slight tweaks to gameplay, of note being an extremely hostile AI when compared to that of the original version. Many believe that this makes the game more challenging, but much less enjoyable than its predecessor as it is nearly impossible to maintain any type of peaceful relations with the AI.<\/p><p style=\"\">Civilization II: Test of Time contains the original Civilization but with different graphics. It also contains a modified fantasy version of the game.<\/p><h2>Console Releases<\/h2><p style=\"\">Civilization II was released on the Playstation console towards the end of 1998. While the core gameplay remains intact, there is no option to utilize the playstation mouse and the low resolution has led to some users complaining about the text being hard to read. To compensate, the entire user interface was rebuilt, though Gamespot reviewer Vince Broady criticized the redesigned menus as seeming, \"thrown together\". Additionally, the game speed was reduced from that of the PC version, with AI turns take multiple minutes to complete.<\/p><p style=\"\">In 2006, Gryphondale Studios ported the game to the N-Gage platform as \"Civilization\". The user interface was again entirely redesigned, this time making extensive use of shortcuts via the phone's keys. The core game, graphics and sounds remained essentially unchanged, but the videos for the various wonders and instances of ingame music were removed to conserve space.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/2\/20248\/680940-civilization_2.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/20248\/680940-civilization_2.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/2\/20248\/680940-civilization_2.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/20248\/680940-civilization_2.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/2\/20248\/680940-civilization_2.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/2\/20248\/680940-civilization_2.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/2\/20248\/680940-civilization_2.png"},"name":"Sid

down, Western style role playing game for the PC with a real-time combat system. Released in 1992, Ultima VII is set in the mythical realm of <a href=\"\/britannia\/3035-416\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-416\">Britannia <\/a>and features the hero character of the series known as <a href=\"\/avatar\/3005-2025\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2025\">The Avatar<\/a>. The story takes the Avatar back to Britannia, where 200 years have passed since the events of the previous game, <a href=\"\/ultima-vi-the-false-prophet\/3030-10012\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10012\">Ultima VI: The False Prophet<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">After being contacted through his computer by a mysterious red entity, the Avatar enters the moongate  in his backyard and travels through the gate from Earth to Britannia.  He finds himself in the town of Trinsic, where a gruesome double murder has taken place.  In the process of uncovering the clues towards solving the murders, the Avatar first comes in contact with The Fellowship, a new philosophical organization founded by a druid named <a href=\"\/batlin\/3005-3310\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3310\">Batlin<\/a>.  The Fellowship follow a new doctrine which conflicts with the Eight Virtues enshrined by <a href=\"\/lord-british\/3005-1401\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1401\">Lord British<\/a>, but make a great deal of how they have improved the lvies of Britannia's citizens.  After leaving Trinsic, the Avatar discovers that the magic users of the world are going crazy, and that the strange material blackrock is somehow connected to it.  By following the trail of two of The Fellowship's leaders, the Avatar uncovers the true origins and purpose of the group.  After foiling the attempt of the Guardian to invade through the Black Gate, the Avatar finds himself trapped in Britannia and unable to return to Earth.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Black Gate is the first installment of \"The Age of Apocalypse,\" the final story arc of the main Ultima series. It strikes a darker tone than its predecessors, which becomes apparent when one of the first things the player encounters is a blood-soaked, grisly murder scene. Corruption -- in both political and spiritual forms -- is one of the game's major themes.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/272034-u7inv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272034\" data-size=\"large\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4910\/272034-u7inv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272034\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/4910\/272034-u7inv.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>inventory system<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Ultima VII features a sophisticated skill and inventory system that allows the player to develop the character in ways that match their playing style. Along the way, you will meet new NPCs, and old friends from past games who you can invite into your party. While Ultima VII was not the first game in the series to feature mouse support, it was the first to feature a \"point and click\" user interface as its preferred form of input.<\/p><p style=\"\">An expansion pack <a href=\"\/ultima-vii-the-forge-of-virtue\/3030-1347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1347\">Ultima VII: The Forge of Virtue<\/a> was released in 1992. It is included in most later releases of the game.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p style=\"\">At the time of its release, Ultima VII was known for being very demanding on PC system resources. Contributing to this fact was the game's use of the problematic Voodoo Memory Manager, which was incompatible with other memory managers.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/136461\/2427328-tetheradon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427328\" data-size=\"small\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/136461\/2427328-tetheradon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427328\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/136461\/2427328-tetheradon.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>EA's Tetrahedron Generator<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Ultima VII was the last Ultima game to be published before Origin Systems was bought by <a href=\"\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts<\/a>. Like Ultima VI before it, the game included several veiled jabs at EA, as Origin had a tumultuous relationship with the publisher even before the takeover. In the game, the evil Guardian uses three Blackrock Generators to disrupt magic throughout Britannia and broadcast his insidious messages into the minds of its populace. The three generators were built in the shape of a cube, a sphere and a tetrahedron, matching the appearance of the original <a href=\"\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/all-images\/52-201475\/electronic_arts\/51-1777475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts logo<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Super Nintendo port of Ultima VII was severely shortened and simplified, leaving out many of the game's darker elements.<\/p><h2>Exult<\/h2><p style=\"\">As Ultima VII is DOS game that is unable to play correctly on Windows XP and beyond, the fan community created a program that allows users to play it on those operating systems. Exult is an emulator designed to allow people who own legitimate copies of Ultima VII to play it on modern operating systems. Development was originally started by Jeff Freedman specifically for the X Window System, hence Ex-Ult. Since it's original development it has been ported across a number of platforms from Windows PCs to Pocket PCs, Linux and OSX.<\/p><p style=\"\">Exult allows players to play through both the original Ultima VII: The Black Gate (with The Forge of Virtue add on) and the sequel Ultima VII: Serpent Isle (with The Silver Seed add on) campaigns. The developers not only allowed players to relive the experience of Ultima VII but also allowed for changes and tweaks to be added to the game and its interfaces.<\/p><p style=\"\">One minor interface change that was added to a version of Exult was to give players the option to use the \"Paperdoll\" inventory system from Serpent Isle in Black Gate. A more recent and larger change was added in the form of craftable items and extra quests. While this required the player download various hacked data files it provided an extension of the original gameplay.<\/p><p style=\"\">While the Exult project has no official support from EA (the current owners of the Ultima franchise) developers of the original game have shown their support, most notably Richard Garriott, who in a letter to the Exult team wrote:<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\">\" Just so that you know.

The game covers the events of X2 and X-men: The Last Stand. The game also fills in the gap between the two films, and explains why Nightcrawler is not present in The Last Stand.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Below are details on the three character's playable on home console only:<\/p><h3>Wolverine<\/h3><p style=\"\">Wolverine\u2019s segments aren\u2019t very complex in terms of gameplay and design. The player controls Wolverine through a set of environments which are usually ground level. A horde of enemies are present - In which case the player must button-mash to work his\/her way through. Most of Wolverines attacks are based on his claws. He can block and perform various slash based attacks. Wolverine also has two special abilities \u2013 One is the ability to recharge health, and the other is called \u2018Fury\u2019 which increases his speed and strength.<\/p><h3>Nightcrawler<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2522\/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504709\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2522\/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504709\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2522\/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Wolverine mashing some foes.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Nightcrawler is probably the most interesting and enjoyable character to play as in the game. The majority of level design is based in the air and involves climbing and swinging from various objects. There aren\u2019t many enemies present during Nightcrawler\u2019s missions. This means the player must use stealth to work his\/her way through. Nightcrawler\u2019s ability to fight is superior to the other characters. He has many abilities which can help him in different situations. One of Nightcrawler\u2019s specialities is to turn invisible. This gives players the chance to generate his health and stay out of trouble. Another unique ability is dash \u2013 This allows players to quickly move from object to object, and confuse enemies as to Nightcrawler\u2019s whereabouts.<\/p><h3>Iceman<\/h3><p style=\"\">Iceman\u2019s missions are high-speed and set in the air. Combat is usually based around fighting flying enemies. Iceman can use three different attacks to take down his foe \u2013 This first is \u2018Ice Beam\u2019 (which can also be used to extinguish fire), the second \u2018Hail Storm\u2019, and the third is \u2018Frost Shield\u2019 which cancels out any damage for a certain period of time. The player can perform a speed boast and 180\u00b0 turn when controlling Iceman, but this often feels flawed and unnatural.<\/p><h2>Playable Characters<\/h2><p style=\"\">There are a total of six playable characters in X-Men: The Official Game (only three of them present in home consoles).<\/p><h3>All consoles:<\/h3><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-10\" href=\"\/wolverine\/3005-10\/\">Wolverine<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2391\" href=\"\/nightcrawler\/3005-2391\/\">Nightcrawler<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-4716\" href=\"\/iceman\/3005-4716\/\">Iceman<\/a><\/p><h3>Unique to handheld consoles:<\/h3><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2281\" href=\"\/magneto\/3005-2281\/\">Magneto<\/a> (Nintendo DS)<\/p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2382\" href=\"\/colossus\/3005-2382\/\">Colossus<\/a> (GBA)<\/p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2850\" href=\"\/cyclops\/3005-2850\/\">Cyclops<\/a> (Mobile)<\/p><h2>Xbox 360 Installation<\/h2><p style=\"\">The amount of memory it takes to install this game is 6.4 GB.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/2280540-box_xmentog.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/2280540-box_xmentog.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/2280540-box_xmentog.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2280540-box_xmentog.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/2280540-box_xmentog.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/2280540-box_xmentog.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/2280540-box_xmentog.png"},"name":"X-Men: The Official Game"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Harpoon is a realistic real-time tactics game set in a realistic Earth, featuring two playable factions, one being the red USSR army and the other being the blue NATO coalition.

The game attempts to blend real-time strategy elements to a first-person shooter with a two-team basis, marines and aliens. On any given level, the aliens have the ability to create Hives in specific places and in these Hives the aliens can spawn in and create a base camp of sorts, whereas the Marines are attempting to prevent the creation of Hives. Each team can build structures on resource nodes in order to get resources for team upgrades. The game is won when one side is completely eliminated with no possibility of respawning.<\/p><h2>Game Modes<\/h2><p style=\"\"><b>Classic<\/b> -- The traditional game mode in which each team tries to completely eliminate the other team's bases or hives. In this mode, one marine will take the role of the Commander who issues orders to the team. Resources are gained by capturing resource nodes, or by killing a member of the opposite team. In this mode there are three hive locations in which the aliens can capture, with each hive capture the aliens will gain access to more abilities and upgrades. Strategies for this mode on the Frontiersmen is to 'lock down' one or two hive locations to prevent the aliens from capturing them.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Combat<\/b> -- Combat mode is a quick alternative to the standard gameplay mode introduced in version 3.0 of Natural Selection. In this mode there are no RTS elements to speak of. The Commander position as well resource nodes no longer exist. Each player is awarded experience points by being involved in combat, and with those experience points they can get any upgrade of their choice. The marines have one command chair and the aliens have one Hive, the team to destroy their opposing main structure first is the winner. Unlike Classic, Combat usually has a timelimit tied to it, which in the case of time running out, the defending team usually marked as the aliens are the winners of the round, while the attacking team are considered the losers.<\/p><h2>Frontiersmen (Marines)<\/h2><h3>Commander<\/h3><p style=\"\">The RTS elements are most applicable to the Commander on the Marines team. As the Commander, he has a top-down view of the battlefield area while in the Command Chair. From here, he can assign squads, issue attack orders, issue build orders, and drop supplies for his team. No marine can drop any given structure, however marines are required as builders for the structures dropped onto the battlefield, without them the structures are unusable. Likewise, no upgrades or item drops can occur without the Commander issuing it. As such, the Commander is very much the leader of the marines and they are dependent on the Commander for victory. Likewise, without good marines following orders, victory is difficult to attain.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Marine Structures<\/b><\/p><ul><li>Command Chair - The structure in which the Commander operates from.<\/li><li>Infantry Portal - Spawns Marine players with a Light Machine Gun, Pistol, and a Knife (and a Grenade if they have been researched)<\/li><li>Armory - Dispenses health and ammo, is required to drop shotguns, wielders and mines.

The second bonus stage had you breaking wooden barrells above you, as they fell from a conveyor bel.

At the time, Japanese game studios feared that if a rival company discovered who worked on their most successful titles, they would headhunt their staff. As a result, the true identities of some of the game's developers remain a mystery to this day.<\/p><h2>Ports<\/h2><p style=\"\">Outside of the <a href=\"\/street-fighter-ii-champion-edition\/3030-1096\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1096\">constant<\/a> <a href=\"\/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-hd-remix\/3030-20616\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20616\">rehashes<\/a>, Street Fighter II was also ported to just about every video game console, handheld, and computer ever created.<\/p><h3>Consoles<\/h3><ul><li>The first home release came to the SNES in 1992. It introduced Versus Mode, along with the ability to set up individual player handicaps.

An optional six-button controller was also created, specifically for the game.<\/li><li>A port for the Sega Master System was released in 1997 in Brazil, produced by Tec Toy. Although it was based on Champion Edition, the game's character designs, graphically, resembled that of Street Fighter II.<\/li><li>1997 also brought the release of <a href=\"\/street-fighter-collection\/3030-7699\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7699\">Street Fighter Collection<\/a>, for the Playstation and Sega Saturn, which collected Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, <a href=\"\/super-street-fighter-ii-turbo\/3030-1251\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1251\">Super Street Fighter II Turbo<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/street-fighter-alpha-2\/3030-19134\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19134\">Street Fighter Alpha 2<\/a> Gold on one disc.

Many new technologies are used by Russia and the Allies including Tesla, the Chronosphere's teleport, Iron Curtain's invulnerability and the Gap Generator's satellite surveillance blocking system. Ore, the most abundant and valuable resource on the planet, is the primary resource that funds the military might of the Soviets &amp; Allies.<\/p><p style=\"\">The War over land and the resources it brings has gotten deadly in this alternate universe as the Soviet Union deploys Mammoth Tanks &amp; Tesla Coils to crush the allies. Not only does the war rage on land, but also in the air and on the oceans.

Quickly Stalin's plan comes to fruition as nearly all of Europe falls to his unstoppable Soviet war machine. With Great Britain the only free country standing ,hopes are grim. But even though they are outgunned, they are not outsmarted. Using Einsteins Chronosphere mass teleportation device, the allies manage to get behind the Soviet forces, slowly retaking Europe and eventually fight back to Moscow to save themselves from the communist oppressors.<\/p><h3>Allied Ending<\/h3><p style=\"\">Following the destruction of the remaining Soviet forces, Allied soldiers find the Stalin buried in the rubble of the former Soviet stronghold.

The goal of each case, of course, is to find the culprit and discover the truth as led by the evidence. To solve the case, the player has a handful of crime scene investigation tools (i.e. rubber gloves to collect basic, big pieces of evidence, tweezers for bullets found in walls from gun fights and fingerprint powder for, if you haven't already figured it out, collecting fingerprints.) at his disposal. If the player gets somehow stuck in a case, there's always going to be the partner to come and ask for some advice. Each case the player gets a new partner, eventually getting to see and ''work'' with every main character from CSI: Vegas. At the end of each case, the player gets an evaluation score based on how well he's collected and followed evidence and if the player has asked any advice to his partner.<\/p><p style=\"\">The voice acting is done by the show's original cast with exceptions of Catherine's and Sara's characters who are voiced by Edie Mirman and Kate Savage respectively.<\/p><h2>CSI Crew<\/h2><p style=\"\">For each case you undertake you'll be backed up by another CSI member who will help you asses the crime scenes, interview witness, and offer their insights into the evidence.

GRAW2 was published by Ubisoft and released on March 6, 2007. As of April 26, 2007, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 has sold 1 million copies as of April 26, 2007.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">Scott Mitchell and his squad continue their effort to stop the rebel uprising in Mexico, which has taken over the Panama Canal. It quickly becomes clear that the rebels have become a much bigger threat than originally thought when it is revealed that the rebellion is in possession of a WMD, and has the means to attack the United States.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The gameplay in GRAW2 remains very similar to the original GRAW, with the changes being limited mostly to the AI and squad controls. GRAW2 also features Cross Com 2.0, the network that connects the various units in the squad, which allows the Ghost Leader to see from the point-of-view of each of his teammates. The AI squad-mates now actively seek cover and call out enemy positions contextually, using phrases such as \"behind the car,\" or \"under the green roof.\" Their response time has also been increased and new commands have been added.

The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.<\/p><p style=\"\">Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.<\/p><p style=\"\">Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp Gates<\/p><p style=\"\">There are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.<\/p><p style=\"\">Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.<\/p><p style=\"\">Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.<\/p><p style=\"\">Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.<\/p><p style=\"\">In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.<\/p><p style=\"\">In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.<\/p><p style=\"\">At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/nigel\/3005-24746\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24746\">Nigel<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/graham\/3005-24748\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24748\">Graham<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/barry\/3005-24743\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24743\">Barry<\/a>. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/gaza\/3005-24756\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24756\">Gaza<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/roscopp\/3005-24761\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24761\">Roscopp<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/jams\/3005-24766\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24766\">Jams<\/a> to bolster the roster and\/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.<\/p><p style=\"\">Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay.<\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/9\/93770\/2374522-genesis_speedball2_pal.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/9\/93770\/2374522-genesis_speedball2_pal.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/9\/93770\/2374522-genesis_speedball2_pal.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/93770\/2374522-genesis_speedball2_pal.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/9\/93770\/2374522-genesis_speedball2_pal.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/9\/93770\/2374522-genesis_speedball2_pal.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/9\/93770\/2374522-genesis_speedball2_pal.jpg"},"name":"Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe"},{"description":null,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/2942\/1123896-legends_of_valour_coverart.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2942\/1123896-legends_of_valour_coverart.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/2942\/1123896-legends_of_valour_coverart.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2942\/1123896-legends_of_valour_coverart.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/2942\/1123896-legends_of_valour_coverart.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/2942\/1123896-legends_of_valour_coverart.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/2942\/1123896-legends_of_valour_coverart.png"},"name":"Legends of Valour"},{"description":null,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/7900\/286789-skateboard_crazy.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7900\/286789-skateboard_crazy.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/7900\/286789-skateboard_crazy.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7900\/286789-skateboard_crazy.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/7900\/286789-skateboard_crazy.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/7900\/286789-skateboard_crazy.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/7900\/286789-skateboard_crazy.jpg"},"name":"Skateboard Crazy"},{"description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Legend of Kyrandia is a humorous fantasy point and click adventure game developed for home computers by Westwood Studios. It puts the player in the shoes of unlikely hero Brandon, who must uncover his heritage and learn the magic of his family to stop the mad jester Malcolm from destroying the land. Originally released on floppy disks in August 1992, it received an enhanced CD-ROM version with full voice acting in 1993.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p style=\"\">18 years ago the jester Malcolm, a favorite of the Kyrandian court, committed a horrible act of betrayal, killing the king and queen and seizing the Kyragem, the source of all magic of the kingdom. Fearing to confront the power of the gem directly, the royal mystics instead choose to put a barrier around the castle, sealing the mad jester inside.<\/p><p style=\"\">This successfully contained the jester, but also denied the mystics access to the Kyragem. Without any way to replenish their magic, the mystics' powers began to wane, and eventually the day came when they could no longer maintain the barrier, and Malcolm broke free.<\/p><p style=\"\">Now free to take his revenge, the wicked joker starts with Kallak, the old leader of the mystics, turning him into a living statue - trapped in stone with only his eyes left untouched.<\/p><p style=\"\">As Malcolm leaves to wreck havok on the land, Kallak's grandson, Brandon, enters, becoming horrified at what has happened. And if that wasn't enough, he receives a vision from the spirits of land itself revealing that nature itself is dying due to Malcolm's evil magic, and that he has been chosen to stop it - his destiny from before he was born. Startled and confused, Brandon seeks out the help of temple guardian Brynn.<\/p><p style=\"\">Also a mystic, Brynn tells Brandon the only way to restore his grandfather is to defeat Malcolm. She offers him an enchanted amulet to aid him, and sends him off to see Darm, the mystics' master of scrolls, and Zanthia the alchemist, to help enhance the amulet's power. As he goes about the tasks they give him, he faces increasing obstruction from Malcolm, but grows even more determined when he learns of his heritage. He is the son of the murdered king and queen, a prince of Kyrandia and the country's rightful ruler.<\/p><p style=\"\">Eventually, Brandon becomes ready to face the mad jester, and uses a potion to travel to the now desolate Kyrandian royal castle. Confident in his advantage, Malcolm gives the young prince free rein to wander the keep and witness the victims of his twisted magic. But Brandon manages to provoke him by going after the Kyragem, and then finally tricks him into turning himself to stone. With Malcolm gone, the land is once again safe, and Brandon is free to take his place on the throne as king of Kyrandia.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The Legend of Kyrandia is a classic third person point and click adventure game. It had a very innovative interface, abandoning the list verbs common at the time in favor of the single universal \"use\" cursor seen frequently in modern adventure games. The game also featured a streamlined inventory system, where objects in environment were simply picked up using the cursor and placed in the inventory or used on another object directly, without having to wait for Brandon to be shown walking over to them or performing an action.<\/p><p style=\"\">Another unusual aspect is the game's handling consumable items. Rather than restricting the character's use of them, or putting the game in an unwinnable state, it instead simply respawns them, either in a specific place, or randomly across the previously visited locations.<\/p><p style=\"\">Kyrandia did however also suffer from some archaic puzzle design, as some of them are very obtuse. They provided little guidance to the player as to what their immediate goal is or how to reach it, and force the player to resort to simple trial an error to get through them.<\/p><p style=\"\">Brandon can die if the player performs the wrong action, and places where this can happen are fairly common. Deaths lead to the game being over, and force to player to reload a save game or restart from the beginning. Towards the end, the game can also reach an unwinnable state if Brandon travels to the final location without the required items.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p>","image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/9408\/721053-7037_boxshot_legend_of_kyrandia.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9408\/721053-7037_boxshot_legend_of_kyrandia.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/9408\/721053-7037_boxshot_legend_of_kyrandia.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9408\/721053-7037_boxshot_legend_of_kyrandia.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/9408\/721053-7037_boxshot_legend_of_kyrandia.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/9408\/721053-7037_boxshot_legend_of_kyrandia.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/9408\/721053-7037_boxshot_legend_of_kyrandia.jpg"},"name":"The Legend of Kyrandia"},{"description":null,"image":null,"name":"Utopia: The New Worlds"},{"description":null,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/1987\/659647-african_raiders.gif","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1987\/659647-african_raiders.gif","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/1987\/659647-african_raiders.gif","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1987\/659647-african_raiders.gif","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/1987\/659647-african_raiders.gif","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/1987\/659647-african_raiders.gif","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/1987\/659647-african_raiders.gif"},"name":"African Raiders-01"},{"description":null,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/1792\/817072-daretodream_titlescreen.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1792\/817072-daretodream_titlescreen.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/1792\/817072-daretodream_titlescreen.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1792\/817072-daretodream_titlescreen.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/1792\/817072-daretodream_titlescreen.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/1792\/817072-daretodream_titlescreen.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/1792\/817072-daretodream_titlescreen.png"},"name":"Dare to Dream"},{"description":null,"image":null,"name":"webRIOT"},{"description":null,"image":null,"name":"Petka and VICH Save the Galaxy"},{"description":"<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gangsters 2 is a Strategy game developed by Hothouse Creations in 2001.

The player then selects one of the targets as a destination, pilots the bomber to the selected target, and attempts to bomb it successfully to earn points.<br\/><br\/>The Intellivision controller proves very useful in B-17 Bomber, as it uses the number pad layout to allow players to quickly switch between different viewpoints and information screens. In addition, the Intellivoice module gives players distinct voice clips as audio cues during gameplay. Some of these sounds include your bombardier saying, \"Bombs away!\" as bombs are dropped, and other crew members yelling out the direction of enemy fighters; for example, \"Fighters, 3 o'clock!\"<br\/><br\/><h2>History<\/h2>Development on B-17 Bomber began in 1981, when <a data-ref-id=\"3040-72615\" href=\"\/john-sohl\/3040-72615\/\" slug=\"john-sohl\">             John Sohl<\/a> was tasked with creating a game based on one of three concepts that utilized the Intellivoice module. While other programmers worked on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16083\" href=\"\/space-spartans\/3030-16083\/\" slug=\"space-spartans\">         Space Spartans<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1426\" href=\"\/bomb-squad\/3030-1426\/\" slug=\"bomb-squad\">        Bomb Squad<\/a>, Sohl had the responsibility of making an exciting game based on air traffic controllers. Thankfully, the idea quickly evolved into B-17 Bomber once artist <a data-ref-id=\"3040-97755\" href=\"\/bob-del-principe\/3040-97755\/\" slug=\"bob-del-principe\">            Bob Del Principe<\/a> suggested turning the plane into a bomber flying over Europe.<br\/><br\/>By 1982, Sohl created an initial version of the game -- albeit too big for a cartridge and without solid gameplay mechanics. To help with paring and refining the game, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-32234\" href=\"\/stephen-roney\/3040-32234\/\" slug=\"stephen-roney\">           Steve Roney<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-2347\" href=\"\/william-c-fisher\/3040-2347\/\" slug=\"william-c-fisher\">          William Fisher<\/a> were added to development upon completing Space Spartans. However, the game was still well behind schedule and undeveloped, and many of Mattel Electronic's staff had to participate in the game's development in the final weeks to ensure it shipped on time. On the last day of development, when the game absolutely had to be shipped to the cartridge manufacturers, a random visitor to Mattel was roped into playing the game for thirty minutes, which ended up being the only stint of game testing B-17 Bomber received. With the short test successful, the code was shipped off to manufacturers on April 23, 1982, and released shortly thereafter. <br\/><br\/><h2>Gameplay<\/h2>The game starts with the player selecting one of six difficulty levels. The easiest difficulty is a practice level, giving the player 200 bombs to play with and easy enemy defenses. The second level of difficulty starts the player off with an initial payload of 10 bombs, with similarly easy enemy defenses. Each successive difficulty level decreases the initial payload by two bombs and increases the enemy defenses, so the toughest difficulty, level six, gives the player an initial payload of two bombs and extremely tough enemy defenses.<br\/><br\/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/624214-1056212285_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624214\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/624214-1056212285_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624214\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8273\/624214-1056212285_00.gif\"><\/a><figcaption>\u00a0Navigation Map of Europe<\/figcaption><\/figure>     From here, the player is given a map of Europe, including a number of potential targets. Any bombing target can be previewed, which will give a close-up view of the target and the points it is worth. The player then selects a destination, which does not have to be their intended target, and prepares for take-off. The destination can be changed mid-flight. The player can also add bombs to their payload before leaving England, but each additional bomb costs its weight in fuel, meaning the maximum bomb load of 17 (outside of practice) will likely leave the bomber without enough fuel to reach most (if any) targets.<br\/><br\/>Once the player is ready to take-off, they will accelerate the B-17 to 90 MPH, and take to the air. The cockpit view shows the horizon, with blue or green below the horizon depending on whether the plane is above sea or land. The navigation map can also be brought up to see progress towards the target, or to assign a new destination. This 90 MPH speed is rather important, as falling below it will cause the bomber to stall.<br\/><br\/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/624220-1056212461_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624220\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/624220-1056212461_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624220\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8273\/624220-1056212461_00.gif\"><\/a><figcaption>\u00a0Fighting Enemy Fighters<\/figcaption><\/figure>     As the bomber gets further away from England, it will face enemy fighter pilots that will attempt to shoot it down. As these fighters approach, the game will announce both their presence and location; for example, \"Bandits, 9 o'clock!\" The player must switch to the proper gun mount and attempt to shoot the enemy fighters down, or they will damage the B-17. Fighters can also damage the gun ports on the player's bomber, rendering them unusable for the remainder of the flight. Anti-aircraft batteries will also fire flak at the bomber once it is over land, which may damage the B-17 and its bomb targeting sights. The only way to avoid flak is through evasive maneuvers, such as changing air speed, altitude, or banking the plane left or right.<br\/><br\/>Once the bomber is nearly over its intended target, the player should switch to the bomb bay view, which will give them a top-down view of the ground. The game will notify the player of the target once it appears by saying, \"Target in sight!\" The player then aims the bombsights and attempts to hit the target. This may be especially difficult if anti-aircraft batteries have damaged the bombsights, which will cause the crosshair to disappear.<br\/><br\/>When the target has been hit, the fuel load is low, or the plane is too damaged to safely continue, the player should turn back to England. The game will automatically land the B-17 when it crosses England's coastline. Returning to England repairs any damage, and allows the pilot to choose a different payload if desired. However, on the next flight, both the enemy fighters and anti-aircraft batteries will be more difficult to contend with.<br\/><br\/>The game ends when the plane crashes by receiving too much damage, running out of fuel, or pilot error.<br\/><br\/><h2>Scoring<\/h2>Players score points by successfully bombing targets, shooting down enemy fighters, and successfully completing missions. Some categories of targets vary in point value, generally based on their importance or distance inland, which make them harder to reach from the England airbase.<br\/><br\/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Anti-Aircraft Batteries:<\/b> 1 point<\/li><li><b>Airports:<\/b> 5 points<\/li><li><b>Factories:<\/b> 20 to 100 points, depending on distance inland<\/li><li><b>Ships:<\/b> 5 to 40 points, depending on size<\/li><li><b>Enemy Fighters:<\/b> 2 points each<\/li><li>Completing a mission earns bonus points<\/li><\/ul><br\/>Dropping bombs on England results in a <b>heavy<\/b> score penalty that is typically more than enough to negate any points earned.\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0<br\/><h2>Links<\/h2><a href=\"http:\/\/www.intellivisiongames.com\/bluesky\/games\/instructions\/voice\/b17.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Game manual<\/a> at Intellivision Lives.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=741_jmeRtv8&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <br\/> Intellivision TV-commercial: B-17 Bomber <\/a>at Youtube.<br\/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gametrailers.com\/video\/angry-video-screwattack\/32245\" rel=\"nofollow\">    AVGN: Double Vision Part 1<\/a>.

You must find the remaining structure on this planet and destroy it. The message indicates that it is in the center of the mini-map. Select your Remora (Seiki SunFire) by clicking on it once. Then click once at the center of the mini-map. Your main map view turns black because none of those hexes are visible by your sensors. Click once on a hex at the center of the main map and you will see a row of hexes highlight in green, and possibly red. This represents the movement path of your Herc. Green is within range, red is out of range. Click a second time on the same hex, even if it\u2019s red, to start your Herc\u2019s movement.<\/p><p style=\"\">If the structure is detected by your sensors, the Herc will discontinue its move. This prevents you from moving right into the path of danger, possibly with no reactor energy left to do anything about it. The idea here is to move as close to the structure as possible to allow you to fire on it, while saving enough reactor energy to move to safety afterward (the structure is armed). Your best bet on this first turn, is to stay about four or five hexes distant from the structure.<\/p><p style=\"\">First adjust your shields between you and the target to account for return fire. Click once on the Shields button, then click and drag the cursor at the center of the Shields control panel to position your shields between you and the structure. Repeat this for the Fast Shadow. Now, with your Remora selected, target the structure by clicking on it once, then fire by clicking on it a second time. Each subsequent click results in a random firing sequence by all of your weapons. Notice that the structure may return fire. When you have depleted the Remora\u2019s arsenal, repeat these moves with your Fast Shadow. Then select the Move button at the middle left of the screen and click Crouch to place your Fast Shadow in a defensive position. Click once on your Remora and Crouch it as well.

The DNA sample they are cloned from is incorporated into a protoplasm to form a base genetic matrix (BGM). The DNA samples come from former human heroes. In the Bioderm Facility, you may preview a catalogue of BGMs to create a Bioderm.<\/p><p style=\"\">Protoplasm is used because it grows faster than a \u201cconventional\u201d clone and it maximizes the potential of the DNA. Protoplasm is unstable,however, and one of the major ratings a Bioderm has is its Genetic Stability. Stress and overuse of StimGland cause the Bioderm to lose cohesion, making it degenerate into the veiny blue protoplasm from which it was created. Protoplasm also has the interesting side effect of magnifying the electromagnetic field inherent in living beings. Polarizing this field reestablishes Genetic Stability. Certain Bioderms are created with Command potential, which enhances their own electromagnetic field exponentially. It also allows them to stabilize an unstable Bioderm by moving near it (within three hexes).<\/p><p style=\"\">Bioderms have limited life spans, giving them insufficient time to develop their skills through conventional training. Virtual Reality Training became the perfect solution. Bioderms are given Genetic Computer Strand Implants during their initial creation. These DNA Supercomputers benefit the Bioderm in two ways: they retrieve the genetic memories of those skills practiced by the initial BGM donor, and they act as receptors for bioelectric sequence coding to further enhance skills. Bioelectric sequences for specific skills were recorded from the original Herc Pilots during the last Great War, and the best of these became the skill enhancement program codes. Bioelectric sequence coding is combined with a cerebral-direct imaging device to imprint the Bioderm as quickly as possible with additional skill training. While efficient, VR Training is unable to completely maximize a Bioderm\u2019s skill potential. Among themselves, Bioderms refer to this process as \u2018getting the chair.\u2019<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Medvat<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940188-medvat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940188\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940188-medvat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940188\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9409\/940188-medvat.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Meet the Medvat<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">This is where you recuperate and recycle your Bioderm troops.

Of note are exceptionally high ratings using missiles and advanced technology.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Tola<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">One of the most revered Herc Commanders of all time, Tola was born in a Chilean deep-mining archeology site, the son of a tram mechanic, but from the beginning he was different from his peers. A proud and restless youth, he claimed to trace his ancestry to Aztec kings. A natural leader, at 18, he worked to form the first trade union at the site and successfully negotiated safer working conditions for miners. However, his true ambitions lay elsewhere. When the Chilean Mining Corporation became one of the few Earth powers able to field Hercs, he joined their forces and quickly rose in rank.Cool, and at his most creative under pressure, he never lost a battle in his long career as a Herc pilot and Commander. An inventive and tireless strategist, his combat journals were published as The Way of the Herc, still required reading for all Herc Commander candidates. Tola is generally acknowledged as the greatest Herc warrior of all time, and he eventually became one of Earth\u2019s last great leaders. Bioderms created from this template have many desirable characteristics, not the least of which is a high tolerance to Stimgland, but some Commanders are reluctant to have even a copy of such a great leader under their command.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Uru<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940180-dead.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940180\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940180-dead.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940180\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9409\/940180-dead.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Bioderm Death<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Born in the Central-African enclaves, Uru wanted to be a warrior since he was a boy.

He finally found a sympathetic C.O. who recognized the value of his strength and determination, and who helped him pass the pilot exams. Uru's skills developed at an average pace, but he ultimately became an excellent pilot and warrior, and his strength of character made him popular with his squad-mates.

Some historians attribute Jath\u2019s success to luck rather than skill, but others point out his ability to assemble and motivate a team of warriors more skilled than himself, and his talent for using sensor data and high-tech intelligence to strike the Cybrids at their most vulnerable point.

Placed in command of stripped and barely functional Hercs packed with explosives and equipped with ejection seats, members of the Hand drove their Hercs against enemy positions, knowing there was almost no chance they would return. Among the first members of the Vengeful Hand was Kyoko, young and physically frail, she more than compensated with her indomitable spirit. On her first mission she ejected after delivering her warhead, and found cover before the explosion. She escaped in the resulting confusion, and traveled fifty miles across enemy territory before being rescued by a friendly patrol. She immediately returned to the Hand, and over the protests of others, requested a second mission. Her Herc was disabled just short of her objective. Wounded and surrounded, she destroyed her Herc at the last moment, taking an entire enemy squad with her.While her combat abilities and skills were largely untested, Kyoko\u2019s warrior spirit was seen as an excellent characteristic for a Bioderm. Unfortunately, due to the nature of her death, the genetic samples available were less than ideal. The Kyoko Bioderm is unstable, quirky, and prone to Stim abuse during off-hours.

Elana inherited her parent\u2019s charisma and ability to reason and communicate, and she was recognized as a child prodigy. A natural leader, she was immediately recognized as officer material and rapidly rose in rank to command her own squad. Her leadership skills and positive outlook made her a hero during the darkest days of the first Earthsiege. She could inspire her troops to battle against impossible odds, believing not only that they would survive, but they would win. And win they did, again and again, with minimal losses. Her greatest victory came in leading the first successful assault on the Cybrid stronghold in the Antarctic. Elana gained a reputation as a brilliant field commander, and was soon promoted to battalion commander. Though she performed admirably, she quietly missed the close camaraderie of her squad leader days.The Elana Bioderm has excellent potential as a pilot and warrior, with innate command potential.

When a Cybrid attack destroyed the pilot barracks of his resistance cell, he climbed into a surviving Herc and rode out to face the enemy. Outgunned and outnumbered, he single-handedly repelled the Cybrid attack long enough to allow evacuation of the survivors. He was decorated, and offered a commission as a Herc warrior, which he refused, preferring to continue to serve as a Herc mechanic. For the rest of his life, he served as mentor and unofficial advisor to a whole generation of Herc warriors.The Garan Bioderm maintains the technical proficiency of the original, but his personality has been genetically tweaked to make him an eager warrior as well.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Jarvis <\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Jarvis learned to fight in the tunnels of New Chicago late in the first Cybrid conflicts. A street tough, his future seemed short and grim. Then he stumbled on a computer record of a distant ancestor who fought heroically in Earth\u2019s first World War. He identified the picture of his ancestor, standing proudly in uniform, and this discovery changed his life. He decided there was no honor dying in the streets, and if he had to die, he would die a warrior. He placed a copy of the picture in a gold locket which he kept with him the rest of his life, a good-luck charm, and volunteered as a Herc pilot. Intelligent, possessed of well-rounded abilities, Jarvis became an excellent warrior. He entered the conflict too late to see much action, but he was twice decorated, and remained a career military man until his retirement. He died in bed at his family home in New Chicago.The Jarvis Bioderm is a good warrior with the ability to learn quickly. The model has a high initial stability, but a slight flaw in the BGM has artificially elevated the instability threshold.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Jamax <\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">It is known that the original Jamax was a career officer who ended his career with an outstanding personal and command record. His military record is all that survives of his later life, as his entire base was wiped out in the second Cybrid Lunar offensive. A more complete record exists of Jamax\u2019s boyhood however, and in an effort to capture the qualities that later made him a good military man, the Jamax personality implant is based on his early life. As a result the Jamax Bioderm starts out green and untested, and needs repeated combat trials to turn him into an effective warrior. The Jamax Bioderm learns skills quickly, and a Commander\u2019s patience can be rewarded with an excellent warrior.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Xian <\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Xian became a Herc warrior in the first Earthsiege after the Chinese island that was his home was vaporized in a Cybrid sneak attack. Xian was away at school, and was the only person of his village spared. He swore a blood oath against the Cybrids, and spent the rest of his short life tirelessly seeking their destruction. He was killed on his thirtieth birthday in a successful suicide attack against a Cybrid base.The Xian Bioderm has little tolerance for Stimgland.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Borok <\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Borok seemed a competent but unexceptional Herc warrior until fate threw his squad into combat along side a squad led by the not-yet-but-soon-to-be famous Tola, the greatest Herc Commander of all time. Both squads were pinned down by a Cybrid ambush during the of the Antarctic and suffered 80% casualties. Energy weapons were nearly depleted, and it seemed that Tola\u2019s perfect combat record was going to come to a fatal end, when Borok\u2019s skill with cannon turned the tide and allowed Tola to lead the survivors to a surprise victory. Grateful, Tola arranged to transfer Borok to his squad, making him second in command. Their careers were linked until Tola retired to enter politics.Borok occupies a special place in Tola lore. Physically huge, bald, almost monstrously ugly, his gruesome form hid a joyful, optimistic spirit, a fine sense of humor, a surprising intelligence, and a never-say-die attitude. If Tola was the mind and backbone of his commands, Borok was the strong and positive heart. With the exception of his unusual skill with cannon weapons, there were certainly better individual soldiers, but few better men to have as a comrade, and Tola knew how to use Borok\u2019s abilities to their best advantage.The Borok Bioderms retain many of the positive attributes of their template, and many of his weaknesses. Borok is slow to learn the more advanced weapons and technologies. He is brilliant, however, in learning new cannon weapons. His great physical strength shrugs off the negative effects of Stimgland.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Crow <\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940191-newderm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940191\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940191-newderm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940191\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9409\/940191-newderm.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>New Blood for the War<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As a boy, Crow and his family were relocated to one of the \u201chidden cities\u201d of the American southwest. Bitter about the forced move and the Cybrid invasion, he rejected his family\u2019s spiritual ways and embraced technology. A restless and unhappy youth, he distanced himself from his parents and siblings until his parents were killed in a tunnel collapse. Devastated, he turned to a Shaman, seeking guidance. He came to know his spirit guide, and made peace with the spirits of his parents. The restless boy became a calm, determined warrior, entering the service as a Herc pilot. He was legendary for his strength, both of body and of spirit. Cool under fire, he was a source of inspiration to those around him. He later specialized as a scout, where his level-head and reasoned self-assurance served him well.The Crow Bioderm is still an excellent pilot and scout. Gifted with an exceptional ability to learn, he is especially adept at advanced technology. Crow's ancient spiritual beliefs can be unsettling to less-tolerant Commanders and Bioderms. He rarely uses Stimgland voluntarily, saying that it is \u201cdisturbing to the spirit,\u201d and seems rarely to need it anyway.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Andra<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Born on Greater America's Brazilian coast, Andra lost her family to the Cybrids at an early age. She joined a guerrilla group that fought, infantry against Cybrid Hercs, in the jungles of the Brazilian Rain-Forest Reserve. When the Hercs of the Pancho Villa Resistance Cell swept south, Andra joined and volunteered for pilot duty. After being sent north for training, she returned to her homeland, this time fighting the Cybrids Herc to Herc. She was an excellent pilot, and thanks to her time with the guerrillas, a master of stealth and surprise. Perhaps because she was orphaned in wartime, Andra was seen by many as cold and authoritative, but she did develop several strong friendships among outsiders who normally didn\u2019t associate with others.As a Bioderm. Andra has great potential both as a warrior and a leader. She learns quickly in all areas, but is most comfortable with matter-energy conversion weapons, including Plasma devices and ELFs.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><p style=\"\">The original gained the nickname \u201cGunner\u201d from his squad mates.

But Tarsus was the man to have in a fire-fight, good with missiles, a genius with cannon weapons, his Herc could often been seen in the center of the action as Tarsus calmly picked his shots.The Tarsus Bioderm is physically strong, but only of average intelligence. He is reliable and quick to follow orders. While he knows everything there is to know about cannon weapons, the Tarsus Bioderm learns missile skills and piloting at an above average rate.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Qabal <\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">Qabal was Maia\u2019s twin, separated at an early age (the story of their early life, separation, and eventual reunion can be found under Maia\u2019s listing). Qabal was adopted by a commune of nomadic scavengers and traders. For decades they wandered the outer solar system, dodging (and occasionally fighting) Cybrids, and supplying retrieved technology to the resistance. Intelligent and quick to learn, Qabal proved himself a great asset to his adopted family, but he longed to return to the front lines. He worked constantly to keep his body trim and in shape despite the low gravity on the salvage ship, and on his eighteenth birthday, he hitched a ride on a salvage freighter headed for Earth. As an outworlder, it was a struggle to be accepted in the military, but his skill and quick mind won him friends among his comrades, and the confidence of his commanding officers. His career was distinguished, but no more, until he was reunited with his sister at the Battle of Antarctica. It was as part of a team that he achieved his true potential.The Qabal Bioderm retains little, if any, of his donor\u2019s personality due to his experimental origin. Qabal shared his sister\u2019s mental acuity, which is evident in his nearly superhuman ability to learn new skills.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Jai <\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940176-briefing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940176\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9409\/940176-briefing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940176\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9409\/940176-briefing.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>So, what's this planet all about?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When the Cybrids overran the Indian peninsula, some of the few survivors escaped to experimental undersea bio-domes that were under development to house that region's excess population. After the Cybrids, overpopulation was the least of their problems, but the cities provided excellent bases to strike back at the Cybrids. The Dravidian domes were the first to develop sub-Hercs, special Hercs capable of rapid underwater travel, converting to a more conventional Herc mode for land combat. Complex, slow on land, and temperamental, the sub-Hercs were exceptionally demanding of their pilots. Jai was one of the best, as good at repairing and modifying his sub-Herc as he was at piloting it. Fatality rates for sub-Herc pilots was very high, and Jai completed a record 52 missions before being killed by a hull fracture while returning from his last victory.The Jai Bioderm learns quickly but is very susceptible to the negative effects of Stimgland. An effort to correct this somehow affected the protoplasm\u2019s EMF generation capability, giving the Bioderm exceptional Command abilities. This has never been duplicated.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Ma-Yuan<\/b><\/p><p style=\"\">The south Asian tunnel cities fought a long and bitter struggle against the Cybrids.

But Ma-Yuan soon realized that the only way out of the slum tunnels for an intelligent, ambitious young woman was through the military. She threw herself in and never looked back. She entered the Herc forces and soon distinguished herself in combat, becoming \u201cpoint\u201d for her squad, using her near surgical skill with energy weapons and missiles to break a path for the rest.

His role in the Cybrid overthrow was obscure to all but his closest co-workers, and they all had their own guilt to deal with, those few who had survived the Cybrid holocaust. safely sat out the conflagration inside Hard-Post Kansas, a buried military installation that later spawned the First Kansas Resistance. Perhaps it was not guilt felt, but a cold, hard rage that everything he had worked for had gone so terribly wrong. It was then he decided that, if he could no longer control the Cybrids with his consoles and programs, he could control them with fire and force.Rather than enter the military where he was known, volunteered as a courier on a dangerous overland trip to Carlsbad Deep, another surviving installation hidden far inside .

Two keys are apparently safer than one. Chan also tells Lara that he is from an ancient order of monks who live at the Barkhang monastery and have sworn to protect the Tallion. Chan also lets on that the Barkhang monks were ones who sunk the Maria Doria in the first place . However, before Chan can tell Lara any more information, he is shot by Bartoli, prompting Lara to dive into the ship and retrieve the Seraph.<\/p><p style=\"\">Key number one in hand, Lara journeys the Barkhang monastery, and with the help of the monks who live there, retrieves the Talion (key number two) and then rushes back to the Great Wall. After an exciting car chase with Bartoli, Lara opens to door of the Dagger of Xian's chamber. However, before she can snatch up the dagger, Bartoli puts it through his heart and turns into a dragon. In the final boss battle, Lara succeeds in pulling the dagger out of Bartoli's heart, thus saving the day... but only for a moment! In the surprise epilogue, the remainder of Bartolis' men track down Lara at her mansion and invade it.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">New gameplay features that Tomb Raider II introduced were new weapons,extra moves, vehicles, larger levels, more enemies, having more human enemies, and lighting.

And lastly there is the Capture the Flag mode, in which teams must battle for control of the other team's flag.\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>The game's tanks operate under two classes, Steel and Liquid. The Steel tanks resemble tanks that are used in real-life, while the Liquid tanks, are works of imagination. Weapons and power-ups are found around the maps.
